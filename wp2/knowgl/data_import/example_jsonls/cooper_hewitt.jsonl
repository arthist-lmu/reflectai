Their archives include a design commemorating the end of World War II featuring Franklin D. Roosevelt and Winston Churchill, one printed in 1963 for the creation of the independent Republic of Nigeria, and another from 1991 celebrating Nelson Mandela\u2019s release from prison. \nLast year Vlisco created a fabric commemorating an event closer to home\u2014the succession of King Willem-Alexander to the Dutch throne on April 30, 2013.
