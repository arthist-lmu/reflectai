{"text": [{"content": "Self-Portrait with Shaded Eyes\n\nA number of Rembrandt’s early self-portraits relate to the tronies that he and Jan Lievens (1607–74) developed in Leiden, and they feature the kinds of emotional expressions, fancy costumes, loose paint handling, and striking light effects evident in those works. \nEchoes of Rembrandt’s early tronies are seen here in the artist’s expression, the strong lighting effects, and his imaginative costume, all of which differ from the formal presentation of his Self-Portrait of 1632 in Glasgow(fig 1).\nWhereas in that Self-Portrait Rembrandt closely followed the fashion among Amsterdam’s burghers by wearing a wide-brimmed hat and a flat ruff over a black coat, in the self-portrait in the Leiden Collection he has donned a beret, which by the 1620s was considered old-fashioned, although it continued to be favored by artists.\nThe fur-trimmed robe he wears here also descends from sixteenth-century dress and relates to the tabbaard, a type of fur-lined cloak favored by scholars.\nThis combination of beret and fur-trimmed robe may indicate that Rembrandt sought to portray himself within the framework of a scholarly and artistic tradition. Given that he painted Self-Portrait with Shaded Eyes in the year of his marriage to Saskia Uylenburgh, it is likely that he wanted to present himself as a sincere and legitimate artist-suitor, of a type different from artists who were characterized by such slurs as “hoe schilder hoe wilder” (the more of a painter the wilder he is).\nRembrandt’s restrained modeling of his features in this painting also speaks to the thoughtfulness of his self-representation. \nAs Ernst van de Wetering has emphasized, Rembrandt carefully modeled his flesh tones to capture the effects of reflected light in shaded areas, such as around the eyes."}], "id": "Self-Portrait_with_S_ddafc45c16575167ad3d05194c698c18.txt", "annotations": {"Self-Portrait with Shaded Eyes": {"created by": ["Rembrandt", {"o_class_name": "Person"}], "s_class_name": "WorkOfArt", "depicts": [["beret", "costumes", "effects", "costume", "areas", "expressions", "robe", "artist"], {"o_class_name": ["PhysicalObject", "PhysicalObject", "Concept", "PhysicalObject", "Composition", "Posture", "PhysicalObject", "Person"]}], "influenced by": [["Jan Lievens", "tronies"], {"o_class_name": ["Person", "TypeOfWorkOfArt"]}], "instance of": ["self-portraits", {"o_class_name": "TypeOfWorkOfArt"}], "created in": ["1620s", {"o_class_name": "PointInTime"}], "symbolizes": ["scholarly and artistic tradition", {"o_class_name": "Concept"}]}, "scholarly and artistic tradition": {"symbolizes": ["artist-suitor", {"o_class_name": "Concept"}], "s_class_name": "Concept"}, "artist-suitor": {"has characteristic": [["legitimate", "sincere"], {"o_class_name": ["Quality", "Quality"]}], "s_class_name": "Concept"}, "expressions": {"has characteristic": ["emotional", {"o_class_name": "Emotion"}], "s_class_name": "Posture"}, "cloak": {"has characteristic": ["fur-lined", {"o_class_name": "PhysicalSurface"}], "s_class_name": "PhysicalObject"}, "coat": {"has characteristic": ["black", {"o_class_name": "Color"}], "s_class_name": "PhysicalObject"}, "tabbaard": {"symbolizes": ["cloak", {"o_class_name": "PhysicalObject"}], "s_class_name": "PhysicalObject"}, "robe": {"has characteristic": [["dress", "fur-trimmed"], {"o_class_name": ["PhysicalObject", "PhysicalSurface"]}], "s_class_name": "PhysicalObject"}, "costume": {"has characteristic": ["imaginative", {"o_class_name": "Quality"}], "s_class_name": "PhysicalObject"}, "areas": {"contains": [["light", "eyes"], {"o_class_name": ["Concept", "AnatomicalStructure"]}], "s_class_name": "Composition", "has characteristic": ["shaded", {"o_class_name": "Quality"}]}, "effects": {"has characteristic": [["lighting", "strong"], {"o_class_name": ["Concept", "Quality"]}], "s_class_name": "Concept"}, "hat": {"has characteristic": ["wide-brimmed", {"o_class_name": "Quality"}], "s_class_name": "PhysicalObject"}, "costumes": {"has characteristic": ["fancy", {"o_class_name": "Quality"}], "s_class_name": "PhysicalObject"}, "ruff": {"has characteristic": ["flat", {"o_class_name": "Quality"}], "s_class_name": "PhysicalObject"}, "dress": {"has characteristic": ["sixteenth-century", {"o_class_name": "PointInTime"}], "s_class_name": "PhysicalObject"}, "artist": {"has characteristic": ["expression", {"o_class_name": "Posture"}], "s_class_name": "Person"}}}

{"text": [{"content": "Self-portrait with Tousled Hair\n\nSome experts date these two drawings differently, but their similar style and technique (despite the presence of the beginnings of a beard and small moustache in the Amsterdam sheet) indicate that they were made at approximately the same time, circa 1628-29. \nIn both cases, the head was first sketched with thin pen lines, then worked up with a brush and grey wash – an unusual combination of media that creates striking contrasts between light and shade and is typical of Rembrandt’s Leiden period. \nThis combined technique also occurs in a few Leiden-period drawings previously attributed to Rembrandt, but now considered to be works by his friend Jan Lievens.\nThese include the Trumpeter on Horseback, also in the Rijksmuseum (inv. no. RP-T-1947-50), and the Foot Operation, in the Uffizi in Florence (inv. no. 1067 E).\nIn both drawn self-portraits, Rembrandt represented himself wearing a cloak with frogging down the front, which would have had military associations for contemporary viewers. \nThe left half of the face in the British Museum drawing is cast in deep shadow, as if seen by candlelight, and the artist portrayed himself with a half-open mouth, a motif that also appears in some of the early painted self-portraits, such as those in the Alte Pinakothek in Munich (inv. no. 11427), dated 1629,14 and the Indianapolis Museum of Art (inv. no. C10063).\nThe raised eyebrows in the London drawing strengthen the intensity of his gaze, and the open mouth seems to depict the artist while speaking. \nThe Amsterdam drawing, by contrast, is more straightforward in character and thus closer to a rare etched Self-portrait of 1629 (e.g. inv. no. RP-P-OB-723),16 for which it has long been considered a preparatory study. \nDespite the close resemblance, there are subtle differences that have led more recent writers to exclude such a direct preliminary function. \nThe drawing shows how Rembrandt actually saw himself in the mirror, with a hint of a scowl in the eyebrows.\nFor the etching, he added a ‘lovelock’ or cadenette, a fashionably long lock of hair behind his left shoulder, reflecting a hairstyle worn by the aristocratic dandies of the day.\n"}], "id": "Self-portrait_with_T_96443fd44dcf5d6086f2c52e6d54256d.txt", "annotations": {"eyebrows": {"has characteristic": ["raised", {"o_class_name": "Quality"}], "s_class_name": "AnatomicalStructure"}, "Self-portrait": {"instance of": ["study", {"o_class_name": "TypeOfWorkOfArt"}], "s_class_name": "WorkOfArt", "created in": ["1629", {"o_class_name": "PointInTime"}], "fabrication method": ["etched", {"o_class_name": "ArtisticTechnique"}]}, "Trumpeter on Horseback": {"instance of": ["drawings", {"o_class_name": "TypeOfWorkOfArt"}], "s_class_name": "WorkOfArt", "created by": ["Jan Lievens", {"o_class_name": "Person"}]}, "shadow": {"has characteristic": ["deep", {"o_class_name": "Quality"}], "s_class_name": "Concept"}, "face": {"has characteristic": [["shadow", "left half"], {"o_class_name": ["Concept", "Quality"]}], "s_class_name": "AnatomicalStructure"}, "Rembrandt": {"has characteristic": [["eyebrows", "face", "mouth"], {"o_class_name": ["AnatomicalStructure", "AnatomicalStructure", "AnatomicalStructure"]}], "s_class_name": "Person"}, "Self-portrait with Tousled Hair": {"instance of": ["drawings", {"o_class_name": "TypeOfWorkOfArt"}], "s_class_name": "WorkOfArt", "depicts": [["Rembrandt", "cloak"], {"o_class_name": ["Person", "PhysicalObject"]}], "has characteristic": ["gaze", {"o_class_name": "Posture"}], "created in": ["1628-29", {"o_class_name": "PointInTime"}], "fabrication method": ["thin pen lines, then worked up with a brush and grey wash", {"o_class_name": "ArtisticTechnique"}], "created by": ["Rembrandt", {"o_class_name": "Person"}]}, "drawing": {"influenced by": ["Self-portrait", {"o_class_name": "WorkOfArt"}], "s_class_name": "TypeOfWorkOfArt"}, "mouth": {"symbolizes": ["speaking", {"o_class_name": "Posture"}], "s_class_name": "AnatomicalStructure", "has characteristic": ["half-open", {"o_class_name": "Quality"}]}, "Foot Operation": {"instance of": ["drawings", {"o_class_name": "TypeOfWorkOfArt"}], "s_class_name": "WorkOfArt", "created by": ["Jan Lievens", {"o_class_name": "Person"}]}, "frogging": {"has characteristic": ["down the front", {"o_class_name": "Quality"}], "s_class_name": "PhysicalSurface"}, "cloak": {"has characteristic": ["frogging", {"o_class_name": "PhysicalSurface"}], "s_class_name": "PhysicalObject", "symbolizes": ["military associations", {"o_class_name": "Concept"}]}, "Jan Lievens": {"influenced by": ["Rembrandt", {"o_class_name": "Person"}], "s_class_name": "Person"}, "gaze": {"symbolizes": ["intensity", {"o_class_name": "Concept"}], "s_class_name": "Posture"}}}

a three-tiered white linen neckerchief around her shoulders, with lace trim and matching lace cuffs that adorn her bracelet-length sleeves. \nShe wears a high-necked white collar with several thin strands of gold beading, and an ornamental black stomacher accented with a bow from which hangs a single black pearl. \nThis fashionable ensemble was current during the early 1640s and was also worn by ladies in Haarlem and Amsterdam, as seen, for example, in Frans Hals’s (1582/83–1666) Portrait of a Woman with a Fan of ca. 1640 in the National Gallery, London, and Rembrandt van Rijn’s (1606–69) Portrait of Agatha Bas from 1642 in the British Royal Collection (fig 1).\nLike Agatha Bas’s fashionable dress, the ensemble of the present sitter features an amber-colored satin skirt with gold embroidery that contrasts with her black outer gown.\nThe scale of her lacework is much less bold and her accessories less ostentatious than that of her Haarlem and Amsterdam counterparts, indicating her more conservative taste. \nIn keeping with her reserved demeanor, she wears her hair tied back in a traditional hairdo with a matching lace headdress that covers her ears and extends to the sides of her face. \nBased on her dress style, Baer dates the present portrait to ca. 1640–44.\nAnother closely related painting is Dou’s Portrait of a Lady (fig 2).\nIn both of these works, Dou
