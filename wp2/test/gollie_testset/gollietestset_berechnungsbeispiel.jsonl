Maria dell'Assunzione. \nIn the distance, the view over the plain of the Pontine marshes meets the contours of Monte Circeo and the Ponza Islands in the Tyrrhenian Sea. \nThe landscape is painterly animated by a group of peasants climbing up the ancient pavement of the Via Appia. \nTo the left of the road is a well where women in jars draw water. \nThe depiction of the forest landscape and lighting is a natural experience developed through painted studies in the open air. \nCatel had met Johan Christian Dahl in 1820/21 and had studied with him in the outdoors around Naples. \nIn contrast, the figures of the staff, as in many of Catel's other works, show an interest in Italian folk culture, in which the traditions of antiquity were seen intact and alive."}], "id": "Aussicht_von_Ariccia_1f753a73e95453ac9e43e8a495795526.txt", "annotations": {"foreground": {"has characteristic": ["shadowy", {"o_class_name": "Quality"}], "s_class_name": "Composition"}, "church": {"has characteristic": [["Bernini's", "town of Ariccia"], {"o_class_name": ["Person", "PhysicalLocation"]}], "s_class_name": "ArchitecturalStructure"}, "Aussicht von Ariccia gegen das Meer": {"depicts": [["To the left", "mountains", "landscape", "In the distance", "skies", "foreground", "town of Ariccia", "in the background"], {"o_class_name": ["Composition", "GeographicalFeature", "Concept", "Composition", "Composition", "Composition", "PhysicalLocation", "Composition"]}], "s_class_name": "WorkOfArt", "instance of": ["painting", {"o_class_name": "TypeOfWorkOfArt"}], "created by": ["Catel", {"o_class_name": "Person"}], "influenced by": ["painted studies in the open air", {"o_class_name": "ArtisticTechnique"}]}, "In the distance": {"contains": [["Ponza Islands in the Tyrrhenian Sea", "Pontine marshes", "Monte Circeo"], {"o_class_name": ["PhysicalLocation", "PhysicalLocation", "PhysicalLocation"]}], "s_class_name": "Composition"}, "town of Ariccia": {"has characteristic": ["small", {"o_class_name": "Quality"}], "s_class_name": "PhysicalLocation"}, "Maria dell'Assunzione": {"has characteristic": ["church", {"o_class_name": "ArchitecturalStructure"}], "s_class_name": "PhysicalLocation"}, "landscape": {"contains": ["group of peasants", {"o_class_name": "Person"}], "s_class_name": "Concept"}, "To the left": {"contains": [["well", "women"], {"o_class_name": ["ArchitecturalStructure", "Person"]}], "s_class_name": "Composition"}, "Via Appia": {"contains": ["group of peasants", {"o_class_name": "Person"}], "s_class_name": "PhysicalLocation"}, "women": {"has characteristic": ["jars", {"o_class_name": "PhysicalObject"}], "s_class_name": "Person"}, "Pontine marshes": {"has characteristic": ["plain", {"o_class_name": "GeographicalFeature"}], "s_class_name": "PhysicalLocation"}, "in the background": {"contains": ["coast and sea", {"o_class_name": "GeographicalFeature"}], "s_class_name": "Composition"}, "mountains": {"has characteristic": ["forest", {"o_class_name": "GeographicalFeature"}], "s_class_name": "GeographicalFeature"}, "On the right": {"contains": ["town of Ariccia", {"o_class_name": "PhysicalLocation"}], "s_class_name": "Composition"}, "skies": {"has characteristic": ["lit", {"o_class_name": "Quality"}], "s_class_name": "Composition"}}}
