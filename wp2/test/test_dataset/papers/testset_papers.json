In attempting to give a tearful dxpression to the eyes, the painter has made them too liquid, so that they seenm to be dissolving in tears, and actually running out of the young lady\\'s head. The effect is a little over done, and yet it may be allowed on the plea of a sudden suffusion springing up from a momentary bittertlought, The hands are beautiullly painted and very expressive, and Mr. Mayer cannot re ceive too much praise for his arrangement of thle drapery. The conception of this picture is exquisitely poetic, and the feeling is tendler anld beautiful.

The color of this picture, both in light and shadow, is very injudicious; The chiara-oscuro is also incorrect, -There is no difference indicated, eitlher in outline or intensity, between the general shadow thrown across the group by some object out of the picture, and the cast shadows directly under the feet.of the animials. This is an inex cusable error. Among the errors in drawing, we notice all the legs of the animals, the .chest and shoulders of the led horse, the arms and shoulders of the negro on horseback, tbe neck and head of the horse upon which he is riding, and especially the two oxen chained together, who could not possibly take the relative ppsitions in wlhich they are drawn, on account or the well-known law of physics that two bodies cannot occupy the same space at the samue time, .

This is a vast extent of landscape, which, 1rom the total absence of feelingc and the lack ot any one point of Interest or visible eflect, amounts really to nothing, as a- work ot.art. It might be clharac terized as a portrait of the American flag and the flagstaff on which it is hung; and its value might be appreciated by the fact that the subject, being being upon a large scale, necessarily required a correspondingly large canvass.

Wlhether this is occasioned by some wound which he has received, but of which there is no outward indication, or is owing to some absence ,of mind on the part of the painter, we do niot know. But the fact remains that the unfortunate hero is as utterly and hopelessly blind as the tishes in thie Mammoth Cave. At the next Acad emy Exhibition, we expect to see a numiber of fi, ures painted without noses, which would make an agreeable variety. Apart from this, there is really striking merit in the picture, both as to color and-character.']"

Gautier said: \"Art for Art\\'s sake means, for its adepts: the pursuit of pure beauty without any other preoccupation.\" That is-the slenderest kind of an idea, or no idea at all; no purpose, as Lessing suggests, of any kind; no sentiment or thought-simply beauty of compo sition and of craftsmanship. Well, in Watteau\\'s 198', 'Page 200 \"THE VOYAGE TO CYTHERA\" BY WNATTEAU Sepg 9', 'December 1916 THE ART WORLD 201 picture we have this mediocre aim realized most cleverly. Kythera is a large island off the cost of Laconia and in ancient times it was sacred to Venus, who had a famous temple there. The cyclopoedia says: \"To make the voyage to Cythera is a sort of euphem ism which signifies to give one\\'s self up to the pleas ures of love.\" Therefore this celebrated picture of Watteau apotheosizes purely and simply the philos ophy of Hedonism so popular at the end of the reign of Louis XIV. The Messrs. de Goncourt, says this writer, have appreciated with a very fine spirit, and in a highly refined language full of verve, the part that Watteau played in the French school of painting: \"The great poet of the eighteenth century is Wat teau. A creation, an entire creation of poetry and revery has issued from his head, brimming his work with the elegance of a superhuman life which the painter drew from the enchanted visions of his imagination. He has made gracefulness \\'to live again. \"With Watteau gracefulness is no longer that of the\\'ancients, a rigorous and solid charm, the per fection of marble-work in the Galatea, the very plas tic seductiveness and the material glory of the Venuses. Gracefulness in Watteau is just graceful ness. It consists of that next-to-nothing which drapes a woman with an attractiveness, a coquettishness and a good-looks quite beyond physical beauty. It consists of that subtle thing which seems to be the smile of the line, the soul of form, the spiritual physiognomy of manner. All the seductiveness of woman in repose: languidness, sloth, abandonment of decorum, touches of back to back, extension of limbs, looks of carelessness, a rhythm in poses, the pretty touch of bent-over profiles, the backward movement of bosoms, the supple lines of the feminine body and the play of taper fingers on the handles of fans-and the indiscretion caused by tall heels that peep below the petticoat, and the lucky chances of personal bearing, and the coquetry of gestures, and the play of shoulders and all that knowledge which the mirrors of the last century taught woman-the mimicry of attitude and grace-all these lived again in Watteau with his flower and his Walloon accent! \"And what a stage setting! \"A land that was an accomplice, woods full of gallantry, meadows resounding with music, bosquets fitted for the fun of echoes, trees like cradles from which hang baskets of flowers, delightful deserts far away from jealous persons, refreshed by fountains and peopled with marble statues! Water jets sud denly spring up in the centre of courtyards of farms. Suns befitting apotheoses, lovely sunshine sleeping on greensward, verdurous depths visible and trans lucent, delicious country charm, murmuring deco rations beautifully trimmed, gardens embowered in thickets, rosehedges, French landscapes set with the pine trees of Italy! Villages gay with weddings and coaches and ceremonies, and festivals gone daft with violins and flutes! Rustic scenes with the green curtain and stage backed with blossoms, upon which the Comedie Frangaise ascends, upon which gambols the Comedie Italienne. .. \"How happily does this Italian fashion, sparkling and bizarre, unite itself to the infantile French fashion of the eighteenth century! And what an adorable mode is born from these two wedded and interfused fashions-the Watteau mode! A fashion of venturesomeness and freedom, wandering and benign, one that snatches to it the new, the zestful, the provocative; the tailor\\'s shears of an artist that in pure playfulness discovers careless neglect and fine dressing, the neglige of the morning hours and stately dress of the afternoon-shears of the fairies, snipping lively and short, stinting neither the costly stuffs nor the eyes of the gallants; delightful shorten ing of skirts, ravishing rockery of folds, narrow corsage, baskets of silk from which the flowering flesh emerges! 0, ye beribboned shears of Watteau, what a lovely kingdom of coquetry did you not cut and carve in that straightlaced realm of ntins belong ing to the Maintenon! \"This literary fantasticality gives perfectly an idea of the agreeable imaginings of the painter of Fletes Galantes; it would be difficult to express in a style more stimulating, charminig and seductive, ideas and subjects more contrary to the reality. And with respect to the execution of the pictures Watteau is not a whit less spiritual, original and fantastic.\" Here we have a picture devoted to celebrating the joy of living which we call only clever, while the \"Triumph of Silenus\" on page 199, also devoted to the celebration of the joy of living, we call great. Why is Watteau\\'s picture less great than Rubens\\'? First: because the subject chosen by Rubens is of more universal significance-more understand able by mankind at large. Second: because the subject is more clearly and profoundly expressed. This is done through a greater concentration of the attention of the beholder on the expression of the figures, accomplished by a greater unity. There is no mass of vague trees, hills, etc., painted in a scene-painter\\'s way, as there is in the picture by Watteau, who began as an apprentice to a \"decora tor.\" This divides the attention of the spectator too much between the personages and the landscape, thus weakening the expression and power of impression of his picture. Moreover Watteau broke up his figures into about eight different groups, each doing different things. Hence he violates the first law of all truly great art -concentration of effects. In fact his whole picture is scattering in its appeal. While in Rubens\\' picture the appeal is concentrated on Silenus, who easily dominates the picture, and therefore grips us power fully and instantly emotions us with the definite emotion of humor as we see this lusty expression of hilarity; it becomes an abiding joy as we contem plate it. In other words Rubens\\' picture is a power ful, masculine expression of intense life, while Wat teau\\'s is a weaker and more feminine expression of superficial life. Third: Rubens\\' drawing is not only impeccable but powerful, while Watteau\\'s drawing is far less so, giving his effort a far less serious, hence a more dilettante, character. Now impeccable drawing is the most difficult thing in any art and requires the most serious effort. The total comes to this: while Rubens\\' work seems the effort of a Titan, Watteau\\'s seems the effort of a be-ribboned, be-laced and be-perfumed-dilettante -but a dilettante so very, very skilful and gracious in his artificiality, so graceful in soul, so thoroughly radiating the prevailing spirit of his time that it is', '202 THE ART WORLD December 1916 a masterpiece of refined, albeit somewhat theatrical cleverness. The great need of the American world of art is artists who can draw in a vigorous, correct and living manner. To do that requires a power of in tellectual energy possessed only by a man of strong nervous system, one strong enough to engender a will-power sufficiently gripping to hold the mind and attention true to the closest observation of nature, the most faithfully lifelike rendering of the thing seen. All the better if he slightly stylizes what he sees, as Rubens did. It must always be remembered by some of our readers that, everything being equal in two works of art, that is the greater of the two which expresses most profoundly and completely the central idea or emotion it is supposed to express: First, in the totality of the work and second, in the one or two faces of the main figures about which the whole drama of the work revolves. In fact, in the final analysis, not composition or drawing or technique or color should be the highest aim in a work of art, but completeness and satisfying adequacy of ex pression, to which end all the other art powers must act as means and instrument. The face of Christ in Leonardo\\'s \"Last Supper,\" the face of the Sistine\" Madonna by Raphael, the faces of the Marquis of Spinola and Justin of Nassau in \"The Lances\" by Velasquez are the keynotes of those three masterpieces. The adequacy or inade quacy of the rendering of what ought to be expressed on those faces determines the place occupied by each of those pictures in the scale of excellence in the hierarchy of art. In the case of the picture by Velasquez-which he nearly ruined through vio lating the law of the concentration of effects-he saved it only by the masterly sufficiency with which he expressed on the face of Spinola the sympathetic gallantry in which he is accepting the keys of Breda from the defeated Justin of Nassau. In fact, these two figures represent the highest flight of Velasquez as an expressive artist. In this picture by Rubens, on page 199, the ex pression of the thing to be rendered, namely, the joy of living, is conveyed through the totality of the picture and then in a supreme way through the face and torso of Silenus, while in Watteau\\'s picture the same joy of living is expressed only in the totality of the picture and not with any intensity through the individual figures or groups. In fact, it is evident that Watteau, being fundamentally a decorative and not an expressive artist, sacrificed profundity of expression of emotion to surface and decorative beauty, in which he succeeded. But while the deco rative beauty of his picture is no greater than that of Rubens, only different in kind, it falls short in convincing adequacy of expression. Hence, while pleasing to the mind it fails powerfully to rouse our emotion. Rubens\\' picture not only charms our mind by its supreme intellectual qualities but it stirs our emotion and laughter profoundly-at least when we see it for the first time. That is why it is a great work of art, while Watteau\\'s work, falling short of supreme greatness, is only clever. But it is so dextrous in touch, so exquisite in melody of line, so deliciously bravura in its de tail, so suggestive of a Frenchified paradise of Haroun al Raschid, that it is at once a perfect example of motiveless art for art\\'s sake and of spirituelle cleverness; therefore is it fit to serve as a drop-curtain in the greatest opera house in the world to which mankind might come for one of the most necessary medicines-relaxation! Not seriously great, yet greatly clever, it will never inspire to lofty effort-but it will always help to dispel our gloom.']"

      "fullText" : "['A Statue of Aphrodite in the Royal Ontario Museum By CORNELIA G. HARCUM IN 1909 the Royal Ontario Museum of Archaeology acquired a Parian marble statue, which came originally from the mainland of Greece, and with its basis is just six feet high. It was presented to the museum by Sigmund Samuel, Esq. The woman, or goddess (P1. IX), stands majestically with weight resting on her right foot, her right hip projecting, her left knee bent and slightly advanced. She looks in the direction of the free foot. The position gives the impression of perfect repose yet of the possibility of perfect freedom and ease of motion. On her left arm she originally carried a babe, whose tiny fingers still rest gently on her breast. The woman does not look at the child, however, but with a mild, gentle, almost dreamy expression gazes into the distance with the air of one serenely proud of her motherhood. The figure is clad in a thin chiton which quite reaches to, in fact, almost trails on, the ground. This is girt high just under the breast, and has slipped down over the right shoulder, revealing the beautiful neck and shoulder; but with a happy restraint the sculptor has arrested it by the right breast, which it covers. Over the chiton is draped a himation, which falls over the left shoulder, covers almost the entire back of the figure, and is brought round under the right arm. The upper part, in a roll, crosses the front of the body and is tucked under the left arm; the lower part hugs closely the hip and leg to below the knee; the end is caught up by the left arm and falls in graceful folds at the side. This enveloping drapery suggests that of the Muses on the Mantinaean relief and is so handled as to reveal rather than conceal the beauty and freedom of the figure, which has the full proportions of the matron rather than of', 'PLATE IX TORONTO, ROYAL ONTARIO MUSEUM OF ARCHEOLOGY: VENUS THE MOTHER', '46 THE COLLEGE ART ASSOCIATION OF AMERICA. the maid. The lower part of the figure is typically Phidian in that one leg is modelled through the drapery while many folds completely envelop and conceal the other. The drapery on the back of the figure (P1. X, Fig. 1) is less care- fully finished, or, rather, is finished in less detail than in front and on the sides, thus seeming to suggest that the statue may have stood in a shrine so arranged that it was seldom seen from the back. On the right side from the waist to the knee the folds of the chiton may be plainly seen through the himation (P1. X, Fig. 2). The marble has a beautiful creamy yellow tone, but its surface has suffered both from the weather and from the pick of the excavator. It seems probable that the head was broken off and buried long before the rest of the statue fell. Thus protected for many years by its covering of earth, while the body was still exposed to the weather, it retains on the brow and cheeks a polish and finish not found on the rest of the statue. It too suffered some injury, probably from being knocked around while lying beside the statue before it was buried. The hair in front is somewhat worn away. Both ends of the knot on top, and the knot at the back of the head were broken off and have been restored. The same is true of parts of the nose, lips, and chin. The only other restoration on the statue is the plaster which joins the head to the body. Unfortunately, the whole of the right arm and the lower part of the left arm were broken off and are missing. The left side shows that this figure, like so many of ancient times, was not made of a single piece of marble, but was skilfully pieced (P1. X, Fig. 3). The holes and iron fastenings which may still be seen on the left arm indicate where the attachment was made. On the right side, what appears to be a dowel-hole may indicate another attachment. The statue presents a picturesque style of coiffure (P1. XI, Fig. 1). The hair is parted in the middle, and waving tresses from either side are drawn up and tied in a fancy knot at the top of the head. Round the head is a bandeau, which may be seen at the side (P1. XI, Fig. 2). This style of arranging the hair seems not to have been entirely un- known at the middle of the fourth century, and to have', \"m FIG. 1 FIG. 2 TORONTO, ROYAL ONTARIO MUSEUM OF ARCH.EOLOGY: VENUS THE MOTHER FIG. 3 I'\", 'THE ART BULLETIN. 47 obtained quite a vogue during the next hundred years. There are examples which indicate that it may have been used even earlier than 350 B. C. The Apollo Barberini in the Glyptothek at Munich shows a somewhat similar arrangement. Several heads with the hair arranged in this style apparently take their inspiration from Praxiteles or his successors. A head of Aphrodite in Boston (P1. XII), which shows by the oval of the face and the expression of the features that it is the work of an Attic master, probably of the school of Praxiteles, is an example. A marble head of Aphrodite now in the British Museum\\' not only offers an interesting example of this mode of coiffure but also shows a close resemblance in expression to the Toronto statue. The same style of headdress is found on the Capitoline Aphrodite, a variant of the Aphrodite of Cnidus2. Two statues of Aphrodite in the Cook collection3, Aphrodite tying her sandal and Aphrodite Mazarin, are further in- stances of the style, as is also the Crouching Aphrodite in the Vatican\\'. Examples among the later statues of Venus might be multiplied. A head of Hygeia or Artemis in the Barracco Collection, Rome\", which is a Greco-Roman copy of an Attic statue of about the middle of the fourth century, may be noted, as well as a head of Artemis or Core, the original of which belongs to the school of Praxiteles or his 6 sons. This headdress also calls to mind immediately that of the Apollo Belvedere, which may be, as Dickins\\' says, a new version of a work by Leochares. The Oldfield Apollo in the Ashmolean Museum, the Pourtales Apollo, and the Barracco Apollo are further examples which show a some- \\'Reinach, Recueil de ttes antiques iddales ou iddalisdes, pl. 189. Reinach says that this type of Aphrodite was certainly influenced by Praxiteles but does not belong to his school. The author of the original should be sought, he thinks, in the group of artists to which Leochares belongs. 2Von Mach thinks that in deference to the taste of a later age the simple hairdress of the Cnidian was replaced by a more picturesque design. 3Mrs. S. A. Strong, Journal of Hellenic Studies, XXVIII, 1908, pp. 11 and 15; pls. VII, VIII, and X. 4Von Mach, Handbook of Greek and Roman Sculpture, p. 324; University Prints, Series A, pl. 294. 5Reinach, op. cit., p. 149; pl. 188. 6Ibid., pl. 190. 7Hellenistic Sculpture, p. 70.', '48 THE COLLEGE ART ASSOCIATION OF AMERICA. what similar type of hairdress\\'. Professor Gardner2 thinks that this style may have originated with Leochares. It is occasionally found on heads of Artemis, Nike, Eros, Thanatos, Hygeia, and others, but it seems to have been adopted most frequently for heads of Aphrodite and Apollo\\', perhaps because it required a very high type of beauty to make it a success. One would imagine it rather trying for less beauti- ful beings. It is, then, a style which was rarely used as early as the middle of the fourth century, and which became very popular during the Hellenistic Age and later. It was especially popular for the goddess of beauty, and is most frequently found on nude or partly draped figures of that goddess. With this description of the appearance of the figure and the style of the headdress, let us pass on to other problems. One naturally wishes to know first of all whom the statue represents. In the Royal Ontario Museum it bears the title, \"Venus the Mother,\" and that title appears with the first published illustration of the statue, in Art and Archce- ology, II, pp. 61 f., where also a brief description is given. One realizes that whenever a statue is discovered which seems to merit the inscription, \"To the fairest,\" mortals still render the decision to Aphrodite. In justice to other goddesses, however, and women as well, this decision should be questioned, especially as there is no attribute here to help solve the problem. The suggestion has been made that the statue is not that of a goddess at all, but that it is a tomb figure which was erected by a husband for his wife and child who died at the same time. This does not, however, seem probable. It is no doubt true, as has been pointed out by Percy Gardner\\' and others, that many Greek statues, both male and female, from the archaic Apollo statues down, are in reality tomb figures. The Apollo of Thera was found in the neighborhood of the rocky cemetery of that island. The Hermes of Andros was discovered in a sepulchral chamber 1Cf. also Reinach, op. cit., pls. 242 and 243 for a head of Apollo in the British Museum. 2Journal of Hellenic Studies, XXIII, p. 117. 3Cf. Reinach, op. cit., for numerous other examples. *Sculptured Tombs of Hellas, p. 135.', 'I- m FIG. 2 FIG. 1 TORONTO, ROYAL ONTARIO MUSUEM OF ARCHMEOLOGY: HEAD OF VENUS THE MOTHER It tVl M cr4 1-0', \"THE ART BULLETIN. 49 and seems to indicate that the man who died appears in the tomb in the guise of Hermes. Of female figures, the feet of a statue on the Acropolis were found attached to an in- scribed basis which shows that the statue was set up as an image of the deceased. There are also female seated figures of an early age which appear to have adorned tombs: a charming example is the so-called Penelope, in the Vatican, seated in pensive mood, the original of which dates from the fifth century B. C.' The Museum of Berlin has acquired two interesting statues of women seated in attitudes of grief, which almost certainly belong to tombs; they date, probably, from the fourth century B. C. The Mourning Woman of Trentham2 in the British Museum is another example of a tomb figure. The style and subject suggest that it was originally set up in the Athenian Ceramicus, for which even Praxiteles is said to have made statues. Examples might be multiplied to show that many statues not always so considered are in reality tomb figures. There seems to be, however, as Gardner has said, a curious similarity of type about all the draped female tomb figures. This similarity is not shared by our figure. Usually the mantle envelops even the arms and hands in its folds, and frequently it covers the head also. Frequently, too, the head is slightly bowed, and there is almost invariably a suggestion of gentle melancholy. This is true, on the whole, of fourth and fifth century reliefs of family groups, as well as of single figures. Even when the women on these reliefs are represented as attending to the affairs of daily life and not as bidding their families adieu, here breathes from the monuments, in most cases at least, a sentiment of sadness. Neither the enveloping drapery nor the suggestion of melancholy are apparent in the statue of the Royal Ontario Museum, which seems only serenely happy. It may be noted, too, that on tomb reliefs where mother and infant appear, the child is usually in the arms of an attendant3. Ten reliefs of mother, and child in 'Cf. Collignon, Les statues fundraires dans l'art grec, fig. 60. 2E. A. Gardner, Journal of Hellenic Studies, XXVIII, 1908, pls. XXVII- XXIX. 3Cf. Journal of Hellenic Studies, XIV, 1894, pp. 267 ff., where A. H. Smith describes two Greek reliefs in the British Museum.\", \"50 THE COLLEGE ART ASSOCIATION OF AMERICA. swaddling clothes are illustrated by Conze. In all of these the child is held by the attendant, not by the mother'. Furthermore, Professor Currelly assures me that there is nothing in the provenance of the Toronto figure to suggest that it comes from a tomb. There does not, then, seem to be much evidence for regarding this statue as a tomb monu- ment. Its size, while not impossible for a woman, is of heroic proportions, more appropriate for a goddess. The majesty of pose certainly seems indicative of a goddess. The winsome sweetness of expression, the suggestion of a smile, the ease and grace of motion seem to point to the goddess who was the ideal of all womanly beauty and charm. The coiffure, too, as we have seen, is one which was frequently adopted for the goddess of beauty. We often associate the nude with Aphrodite, but we must be careful to remember that this association is derived from late representations of the goddess. In archaic art, with the exception of the Cypriote statuettes, she usually appears fully clad. In the fifth century, as far as we know, there was no Greek statue of a nude goddess'. The gold and ivory statue of Aphrodite in Elis by Phidias, the Aphrodite Ourania in Athens8, also by Phidias, the Aphrodite in the Gardens by Alcamenes were all, no doubt, fully draped. On vases Aphrodite is usually clad, and also on early mirrors and terracottas. Down to the middle of the fourth century the fully clothed figure predominates. When Praxiteles presented to the people of Cos the choice between a draped and an undraped Aphrodite, the story goes that they unhesitatingly accepted the former. The far greater fame and popularity of his undraped Aphrodite, which then went to the people of Cnidus, may have started the rage for the nude, which grew steadily stronger for the next hundred years and later. That the undraped goddess was an innovation in the time of Praxiteles is shown by the fact 1Conze, Die attischen Grabreliefs, pls. 274-9, 281, 3, 6. Cf. also Journal of Hellenic Studies, XVI, 1896, pl. VII; here a standing nurse hands an infant to a seated mother. 2Miiller, Nacktheit und Entbliissung, p. 145, speaks of an archaic Greek marble cult statue of a nude Aphrodite found at Orvieto, and there are several Peloponnesian nude representations in bronze. The so-called Esquiline nude Venus is probably a hetaera. D. M. R. SPausanias I, 14, 7.\", 'PLATE XII BOSTON, MUSEUM OF FINE ARTs: HEAD OF APHRODITE', 'THE ART BULLETIN. 51 that an explanation of nudity was supplied by the indica- tion that the goddess was preparing for the bath. Even the later Venus of Arles is partly nude because she is at her toilet. In early times disrobing required a motive to account for it. In modern times we are prone to think of Aphrodite as merely the bewitching goddess of lighter love, who beguiles both mortals and immortals by her charms. There is, however, considerable evidence both in literature and in art that in antiquity she was regarded as mother also. Certainly in literature this function is repeatedly ascribed to her. A Homeric Hymn\\' tells vividly the story of her infatuation, Zeus imposed, for Anchises. She herself prophesies to this beloved mortal, \"To thee, Anchises, shall a dear son be born.\" That the goddess had no in- tention, however of taking her duties as mother too seriously is quite evident, for she continues, \"So soon as he sees the light of the sun, the deep-bosomed mountain nymphs shall rear him for me.\" Nor was she anxious to reveal this love affair with a mortal; she charges Anchises, \"But if any mortal asketh thee what mother bare this thy dear son, say that he is thy son by one of the flower-faced nymphs.\" Hesiod2 says also, \"Cytherea with the beautiful crown was joined in sweet love with the hero Anchises and bare Aeneas on the peaks of Ida with its many wooded plains.\" And Homer3 emphasizes the relationship. He speaks of Aeneas, whom holy Aphrodite bore. Aeneas himself says\\', \" The sire I boast is Anchises, great of heart, and my mother is Aphrodite.\" Indeed, in the Trojan War, so strong is the love of the golden mother that she forgets that not for her are the works of war, and she enters battle and is wounded to save her son Aeneas, whom she proclaims the dearest to her of all men. Nor was Aeneas her only child. Hesiod\" tells us that Cytherea bore to Ares, the shieldpiercer, Panic and Fear, \\'No. V. 2Theogony, 1008.

Moreover, she was the mother of Harmonia. The union of Aphrodite and Eros, says Bernoulli', is post-Homeric and is found first in the poetry of Hesiod. The ancestry of Eros is decidedly uncertain. In Hesiod he is, with Earth and Chaos, one of the primeval beings2, but also he is the companion of Aphrodite3. According to a later and com- moner tradition of his birth, he was the youngest of the gods whose mother was Aphrodite, and his father was Ares, or, less commonly, Hermes. His brother Anteros also was supposedly descended from Aphrodite and Ares. Hence, according to literary tradition, Aphrodite was the mother of at least six children: Aeneas, Harmonia, 0o016, AEL.IR , Eros, and Anteros. The literary tradition of Venus as mother appears to be, in early times at least, stronger than the artistic. In art Eros seems to be the only one of her children who is rep- resented with her; and even he is, no doubt, frequently considered merely her companion or attribute, so to speak, not necessarily her child. Probably the earliest union of the two is found on mirrors. In an example in the British Museum, of the last half of the sixth century, the figure of Aphrodite forms the stand, while from the mirror hang two winged boys, Erotes'. Another early representation of Aphrodite and Eros is found on a terracotta relief, probably dating about 450 to 440 B. C5. Aphrodite holds a pome- granate blossom in her right hand, and on her outstretched left arm stands Eros. A Greek terracotta of the transition period found in a tomb at Corinth, and now in the museum at Athens6, shows Aphrodite standing with Eros at her side. On the east frieze of the Parthenon Aphrodite is seated and a winged boy, Eros, leans agains her knee as she points out to him the Panathenaic procession.

It is barely possible that the draped Aphrodite of Cos may have been represented as mother, but it is not probable. At any rate, the statue in the Louvre, which Furtwaingler2 considers a copy of the Aphrodite of Cos, has a little Eros standing beside it. Furtwingler says, how- ever, that this figure of Eros could not have belonged to the original but is the work of the copyist. Engraved gems of the best period of Greek art also show the two characters together. On a translucent carnelian scaraboid from Kertch in the Hermitage Museum, a seated woman, probably Aphrodite, clad in a long tunic and mantle, leans forward to kiss a nude winged Eros, and on a carnelian ring stone in the British Museum Aphrodite, fully draped, save for her right breast, which is bare, is seated with a nude winged Eros leaning against her3. It is interesting to note that in all of these early examples, wherever found, Eros is not an infant, but a lad or small boy. It has been aptly said that he grows steadily younger from the youth of Praxiteles (though even before that he is rep- resented as a boy) to the boy of Lysippus. It is not until the Hellenistic Age that he reaches infancy and that we find the chubby Cupid so beloved in Hellenistic and Roman art and so frequently found with the nude Aphrodite'. It is also significant that in none of these representations of Aphrodite and Eros, and in very few of the many of later times is the goddess holding the child in her arms. He usually stands at her side, or is perched on a dolphin or on her shoulder. These facts suggest that the statue which we are con- sidering, although it may possibly represent Aphrodite as holding in her arms one of her own children, really bears a stronger resemblance to a development of the mythological 'Op. cit., p. 13. 2Masterpieces, p. 323. 3Cf.

This type appears in Greek art at a very early time, but probably by the third century it loses most of its mythological signifi- cance and becomes, in the Tanagra statuettes, a purely genre type of mother and child. Both seated and standing figures are found at all periods, and almost always the goddess tenderly holds one or more children in her arms\\'. Naturally, the first goddess to appear in this capacity, and the one most frequently so represented, is Gaea, the earth goddess, who typifies the kindly, fostering care of the soil, and is the all-mother, who nourishes all living things on earth, in sea, and in air. She is called KovpoTrpO~o in Hesiod2, where Rhea gives her, as probably the first of her charges, Zeus, the youngest of her ch ldren, to save him from the fate of his brothers: \"Him did the vast Earth receive from Crete to nourish and bring up, and she came carrying him swiftly through the black night to Lyctus.\" In a Homeric Hymn3 Gaea is called the mother of all. Frequently, she is represented as fostering two children, as on the Carthaginian relief4, where she is seated on a rock; fruit lies in her lap, and a lamb and calf are at her feet. On a black-figured vase reproduced by Gerhard\\' there is a goddess who carries two children in her arms; she is un- doubtedly Gaea, according to Roscher. And again, on a black-figured amphora in the Louvre6 she has two children. The same type with two children is found also in an archaic terracotta statuette from Rhodes\\'; and many primitive Cypriote terracottas represent Gaea KovporTpO\\'6o, or Earth as nursing mother\\'. Several other goddesses, notably Demeter, shared with Gaea this function of KOvpoTrp oS, nurse or fosterer of \\'Cf. British Museum Catalogue of Terracottas, pl.

A terracotta statuette of Demeter in the British Museum' stands with right leg bent, holding against her breast a child in her left arm. The goddess Tyche also appears as the KovpOTpco09 of a special place. She is found in this capacity on coins of Melos of imperial date. Here she is bearded and holds a child on her left arm. The charming statue by Cephisodotus, of Eirene , the god- dess of Peace, nursing the child Plutus, Wealth, is, of course, the best known example of the type of the KovpOTpO'O9 or fostering goddess. This statue illustrates a new ten- dency appearing in the art of the beginning of the fourth century, or of the end of the fifth. Its touch of nature and human affection remind one of the Madonna and Child of medieval art, and it is undoubtedly a prototype of the motif of mother and child which has been so popular throughout the ages. Eirene bears the epithet KovpOTpopO9 in Euripides8, and Hesiod' says that Peace, the nurse of children, is abroad in the land. This early fourth, or late fifth, century group of Peace with her child Wealth may possibly have suggested Praxi- teles' treatment of his Hermes, which is a still further ex- tension of the same idea, though this time a god, not goddess, is the fosterer of youth. The elder brother at the command of his father Zeus is taking the baby Dionysus to the nymphs of Nysa to be reared. However, as Gardner has well pointed out3, Hermes is not a mere abstraction, a representation of the idea of protector and fosterer of youth. He is, indeed, a real personality, a god made human, but he is nevertheless a development of the earlier mythological conception. Still another famous group of a somewhat similar type is that of Silenus holding the nfant Dionysus. Klein6 calls this a third generation and says that it was called to life by 1Ibid., C. 495, p. 238. 2There are copies of this in New York and Munich. 3Bacchae, 420. 4Works and Days, 228. Cf. also representations of this goddess on coins of Athens and Cyzicus. 5Six Greek Sculptors, p. 145. 6Praxiteles, 396.\", '56 THE COLLEGE ART ASSOCIATION OF AMERICA. the Hermes, and that as in the Eirene and Plutus we see the past of the Hermes, in this group we see the future. The group is more dramatic, and the child, which is simply a foil to Hermes, is here definitely half of the composition. It is, then, extremely common in Greek literature and art to find a god or goddess as nurse, nurturer, protector of youth, and many are so represented: Gaea, Tyche, Demeter, Eirene, Hermes, Athena, and others. In some of the representations, however, as in those of Eirene and Hermes the mythological significance may be secondary to the political meaning of the statue. To such a series I think our statue of Aphrodite may belong, though it is difficult to say how much of the mythological concept it retains. We do know, however, that the function of Aphrodite KOVpo~rp oo is extremely old. This is shown by the story in the Odyssey\\' of the children of Pandareus, who knelt alone, orphans in the palace, nourished there by blessed Venus with curds and honey and sweet wine. Even though there is no monument which we may certainly call Aph- rodite KOVporpo\\'Os, there are, as we have seen, many representations of goddess and child. In the absence of an attribute or symbol which reveals Aphrodite, it has been the custom to consider these as representations of Demeter or Gaea. However, some of them may represent Aphro- dite2 , and it is particularly probable that some of the primitive terracottas of woman and child portray this goddess . Another reason for thinking that the statue in the Royal Ontario Museum is Aphrodite KOVpoT7p6o0 is the grow- ing tendency to associate or identify Aphrodite with Gaea, the earth goddess. Professor Fox4 says of our example that Aphrodite here seems to represent the special develop- ment of the earth goddess, who typified the kindly fostering care of the soil. He has since published an article entitled \"Aphrodite, Mother Earth,\"\" in which he brings together 1XX, 67. 2Bernoulli, op. cit., pp. 121-123. 3Cf. British Museum Catalogue of Terracottas, A. 10-14. 4Mythology of All Nations, Greek and Roman, pl. I. 5American Journal of Philology, XLI, no. 3, p. 283 ff.', \"THE ART BULLETIN. 57 the literature suggesting that Aphrodite was originally an earth goddess. Farnell' reaches the conclusion that the terrestrial aspects of the goddess are the primitive ones. Professor Fox, after a detailed study of the Aphrodite myth and cult, reaches the same conclusion, and goes further. From a recent discovery by French excavators of the sacred inner omphalos of Delphi and from a passage in Hesychius, 7y\\x7f \\x7fak o aX 'rd a ol Kal AEX\\x7fol2 the Delphic omphalos seems to be earth's own image. If Hesychius' statement is true, says Professor Fox, it follows that also the Paphian omphalos is earth's image; but since the omphalos of Paphos was regarded as an image of Aphrodite, one is forced to regard Aphrodite herself as the earth goddess. If she is identical with Gaea, the earth goddess, she no doubt shared with her the function of Kovpor7poos and is so repre- sented in art. To sum up, then, this statue in the Royal Ontario Museum may represent Aphrodite KovpoTrpOdo4 because of the position of the child, which was held in her arms, not perched on her shoulder or standing by her side, as Eros usually is; because Aphrodite is certainly one of the &0aZ KOvporpo4Ot; because she is closely associated with, or is, the earth goddess, whose chief function was nurturer of youth; and because the statue bears a certain resemblance to such others as those of Eirene. An important question is the date of the statue. The figure has the full, solid proportions of the early draped goddess. It shows a restraint and lack of the voluptuous softness which is especially characteristic of later statues of Aphrodite. This is particularly true of the breasts. ReinachW, who believes that the form of the breasts and their distance from each other furnish reliable evidence for dating female sculpture, thinks that on this statue they indicate an early date. The serenity and lack of senti- mentality in the face suggest at least a fourth century origin. 'Cults of the Greek States, II, pp. 642-653, 750-755. 2Eumenides, 1-8. 3Revue des Otudes grecques, XXI, 1908, pp. 13 ff.\", '58 THE COLLEGE ART ASSOCIATION OF AMERICA. The rhythmic pose indicates Praxitelean influence. The high girt drapery, too, may be, as the figure of Artemis from Citium, now in Dresden\\', and the Muses on the Mantinaean relief show, as early as Praxiteles; but it is probably not earlier. The style of headdress came in, as we have seen, about 350 B. C., though it was more fre- quently used later. The pose, then, the high drapery, and the headdress date the work probably as late as the second half of the fourth century; and if the figure is that of Aphrodite bearing in her arms the infant Eros, it cannot be earlier than Hellenistic times, since Eros does not reach infancy before this time. Another indication of Hellenistic date is found in the drapery. On the right side of the statue, as we have observed, the folds of the chiton show clearly through the mantle. Dickins2 calls attention par- ticularly to this Hellenistic drapery, which is transparent not, as earlier drapery, for the purpose of displaying the body beneath it, but for displaying other drapery.3 On the whole, therefore, it seems probable that the statue is of Hellenistic date, of about the end of the fourth century4, and that it shows certain eclectic features common to Hellenistic sculpture: the Phidian leg, the Praxitelean pose, the rather small head of Lysippus. It is true, as Dickins\" says, that Attic artists of the late fourth and the third century made use of all their predecessors and pro- duced statues in which we find the disiecta membra of half a dozen styles. At the same time, we may recognize in the Toronto example the predominance of Praxitelean tradition. \\'Cf. FurtwAngler, op. cit., fig. 141. 20Op. cit., p. 45. 3This style of drapery and especially the position of the feet remind me of Roman female statues of vestals and others, types which go back, however. to Lysippus and Greek originals (Cf.

R. 4I am inclined to date the statue in Hellenistic times, but later than 190 B. C. Transparent drapery hardly existed before the time of the great altar at Pergamum, and transparent drapery of the Rhodian type not before 190 B. C., as Dickins (op. cit., p. 46) says. D. M.

            "fullText": "Hokusai's Great Waves in Nineteenth-Century Japanese Visual Culture. Katsushika Hokusai's Under the Wave of Kanagawa (Kanagawa\noki namiura), popularly known ni the Anglophone world as The Great Wave, occupies an iconic place in modern visual culture (Fig. 1). Widely cited in word and image, included in exhibitions around the world, the focus of a documentary film ni aseries about artistic masterpieces, and, most recently, featured ni the British Museum/BBC radio program The History of the World in One Hundred Objects, it is, in the eyes of many Euro-Americans, Japan's most representative artwork. This is not true in the country of its origin, however, owing to the fact that it is not a unique work of art but a woodcut of which thousands of impressions were made for popular con- sumption. Okakura Kakuzo, writing in 1900, called into ques-\ntion the print's authenticity as a representation of Japan when he declared that \"the history of Japanese art cannot be written through ukiyo-e.\"' In his view, the Euro-American privileging of \"pictures of the floating world\" failed to take into account their true cultural place in the country that produced them. And yet, the modern-day celebrity of The Great Wave cannot be explained without recourse to its recep- tion in nineteenth-century Japan. Looking at the sociocul- tural context in which Under the Wave of Kanagawa was pro- duced and consumed helps to explain how and why it came to be singled out from the series Thirty-six Views of Mount Fuji of which it is a part.\nScholars in Japan, Europe, and the United States have examined this image's artistic and design elements chiefly in relation to Mount Fuji, with interpretations predicated on Hokusai's personal devotion to the immortal mountain, the new spirit of empirical inquiry expressed in his views of it, or\nits privileged status as an emblem of Japanese national iden- tity? These approaches, though appropriate given that the mountain defines the series, overlook the multiple levels on prmut eett which this particular view may be read, as well as the many readings of the wave itself, which may be related to a range of\nimages, practices, institutions, and texts.\nUnder the Wave of Kanagawa was but one of many renditions\nof a motif that cumulatively registered a new interest in\nmaritime imagery in Japan from the 1790s through the\n1860s. Waves already had a long and multivalent history in\nJapanese literary and visual arts before the nineteenth cen-\ntury, but during this period, external and internal events\ncombined to make them critical sites through which many\nartists, but most notably the prolific and long-lived Hokusai,\nprovoked thought about their country's shifting geopolitical\ncircumstances and, especially, its vulnerability to foreign in- cursions.\"\nOver a career spanning six decades, from the 1790s until his death ni 1849, Hokusai produced image after image of waves. No other artist before him treated this subject so\nobsessively or creatively. There are scenic views of waves breaking on the beach at Enoshima; book illustrations of\nwaves identified with legendary feats of heroism and self- sacrifice; designs of waves for the decoration of personal accessories and architectural interiors; artists' instructional\nmanuals with incoming and outgoing waves; depictions of waves in the formal, semiformal, and cursive brush styles; a boat fighting waves to enter the famous Cave of the Three Deities; rabbits running over waves; ghosts haunting the waves where ships had foundered; a great wave seemingly morphing into plovers; male and female waves; One Thousand Images of the Sea, a series (never completed) whose title, Chie no umi, may be understood acoustically to mean \"sea of wisdom\"; and even a Taoist magician conjuring waves from the palm of his hand. While many of these enjoyed wide circulation, Hokusai's many variations of a single great crest- ing or tumescent wave especially captured the public imagi- nation by bringing into an integrated and magnified aes- thetic focus disparate external disruptions whose full import was not yet fully perceived or understood. As Susan Stewart has written in another context, \"the gigantic presents us with\nan analogic mode of thought... [involving] the selection of\nelements that will be transformed and displayed in an exag- gerated relation to the social construction of reality.\"' Widely disseminated in his own prints and illustrated books as well as in reinterpretations by other artists, Hokusai's \"great waves\" commented on a new maritime reality by their singularity, heroic scale, pictorial style, and even their very materiality.\nFears of Foreign Invasion\nThe idea that the waves encircling the Japanese islands shel- tered them from outside intruders was deeply rooted in Japanese thinking. In a poem in the eighth-century anthology Man'yoshu, Japan si described as a beauteous island \"hidden by athousand lapping waves.\"* But waves did not simply hide and protect; a passage in the Nihonshoki, a mythologizing account of Japan's history also written at that time, testifies that they were thought to have divine agency as well. The wave was the means through which the legendary Empress Jingü exercised and extended her power over territory on the present-day Korean peninsula: \"The Wind-God made a breeze to spring up and the Sea-God uplifted the billows,\" so that \"without the labour of the oar or helm, they arrived at Silla.\" When the \"tide-wave following the ships reached far up into the interior of the country,\" the king of Silla grew fearful of its destructive force and submitted to the divine power of the invading country? These intertwined notions of Japan as a country protected and guided by divine winds and waves were recurring themes later associated with the abortive Mon- gol invasions of 1275 and 1281 and, fueled by late eighteenth- century nativist scholarship, with the prospect of European incursions.® Evidence of this linkage are the nearly fifty cop- ies of a fourteenth-century illustrated handscroll recounting\nthe drama of the Mongol invasions that were created from the late eighteenth cent\nu\nry\non\nw\nard.'\nJapan was not a seafaring nation during the Tokugawa period (1603-1868). The shogunate had banned the con- struction of all ships over five hundred koku (forty-nine gross tons) \"such that they can withstand high waves and weather a counyrtototrelen,ognifodeaht,theowhlethte waters of the archipelago had sails, oars, and an open stern to prevent them from taking to the open seas. In the 1780s these limitations even led some feudal lords secretly to seek infor-\nmation on how to build better oceangoing ships commensu-\nrate with those that, under the auspices of the Dutch East\nIndia Company, entered the southern port of Nagasaki every summer.\"'\nAlthough only Nagasaki was open to European vessels, this port and others were active conduits for trade with China and Korea throughout the Tokugawa period.!? In the last quarter of the eighteenth century, however, Russian, American, and British ships were also demanding access to ports around the archipelago. Foreign vessels were already regular sights in the vicinity of the southern ports of Nagasaki, but increasingly they were pressing for entry into the northern harbor of Hakodate. As a verse written about 1800 by Tokugawa Haru- mori, the feudal lord of Mito, put it: \"Hakodate Bar- rier / Guardsmen, / Be alert! / This si not a time when only waves come to shore.\"19\nSightings of foreign naval ships of the Izu and Böso Pen- insulas, leading to the bay that gave access to the shogunal capital of Edo, also caused alarm. Hayashi Shihei was one of a number of government officials who, at great personal cost, sought to alert the shogunate that encroaching foreign forces demanded a new outlook on Japan's watery periphery. The need to protect the country from foreign vessels perceived to be as powerfully built as \"small fortresses\" led him to write \"Military Talks for a Maritime Nation\" (\"Kaikoku heidan,\" 1791), which opens with the question \"What is meant by a maritime nation?\" and goes on to address the defense prep ar\nations\nneeded by\na country\n\"bordered on\nal sides by the sea.\"la While he held that defensive measures alone were\nsufficient, others spoke to the need to develop international commercial shipping and trade. Sato Nobuhiro, in his \"Ab- breviated History of the Western Powers\" (\"Seiyo rekkoku shi ryaku,\" 1808), declared, \"There is nothing that compares with shipping and commerce to strengthen greatly a nation's i n t e r e s t s . \" 15\nThe rumored threat of a Russian invasion, followed in 1804 by the so-called Rezanov affair, in which a Russian diplomat landed in Nagasaki in the hopes of opening trade negotia- tions but was turned away, further fueled anxieties. Such chreats led in 1825 to a shogunal edict ordering foreign vessels entering Japanese ports to be fired on, as was the AmericanMorison,whenitenteredUragaBayni 1837,using the return of seven shipwrecked sailors as a pretext for initi- ating trade, as Rezanov had earlier done. Adding to these events, accounts of China's defeat at the hands of the British ni the Opium War of 1839-42, popularized ni the semific- tional \"New Tales of aForeign Land\" (\"Kaigai shinwa,\" 1849), prompted warnings that China's failure resulted from \"a deficient sense of national unity and patriotism.\"16 Expres- sions of growing concern intensified following Commodore Mathew Perry's arrival in 1853 and, especially, the signing of the Treaty Port agreements in 1854 and 1858. Foisted on Japan by the Western powers, these gave extraterritorial rights, first to lands around the ports of Shimoda and Hako- date, and later around Yokohama, Kobe, Nagasaki, and Ni- gata. These humiliating infringements of Japanese sover- eignty were not abrogated until 1899.\nHokusai's Great Waves\nHokusai created a great wave that expresses the outside world both con eptually and artistically. His sweeping view of hte Seven League Beach, Shichirigahama, at Enoshima, with the shrine of Benten and Mount Fuji in the distance, where the singular cresting wave makes its first appearance, speaks to a key locale in which this motif's new twofold pictorial identity was constituted (Fig. 2).\" As the presence of surfers today demonstrates, Enoshima was one of the few places with real waves along the Edo/Tokyo coast. Consequently, waves breaking on the shores of this scenic spot were a feature of many woodblock prints. Hokusai's illustration in Threads of the Wilow (Yanagi no ito), a 1797 album of comic verse (kyoka), however, was unusual in its mobilization of Western perspec- live in combination with a single outsize wave in the fore- ground. Arrested in motion at the moment of cresting, the wave is made to look three-dimensional in a way that makes it as conspicuous a presence in the landscape as Mount Fuji. Despite his study of the principles of linear perspective to situate objects in space, Hokusai deliberately exaggerated the relationships of scale so that the wave competes for attention with the distant cone of the sacred volcano.\nWaves breaking on a shore were not a new pictorial theme, but Hokusai's vision both contributed to and reflected heightened awareness of the actualities of Japan's coastal topography.

Consequently, waves breaking on the shores of this scenic spot were a feature of many woodblock prints. Hokusai's illustration in Threads of the Wilow (Yanagi no ito), a 1797 album of comic verse (kyoka), however, was unusual in its mobilization of Western perspec- live in combination with a single outsize wave in the fore- ground. Arrested in motion at the moment of cresting, the wave is made to look three-dimensional in a way that makes it as conspicuous a presence in the landscape as Mount Fuji. Despite his study of the principles of linear perspective to situate objects in space, Hokusai deliberately exaggerated the relationships of scale so that the wave competes for attention with the distant cone of the sacred volcano.\nWaves breaking on a shore were not a new pictorial theme, but Hokusai's vision both contributed to and reflected heightened awareness of the actualities of Japan's coastal topography.

There si no evidence that Körin's playfuly disruptive imagé was intended as a tidal wave, but the artist would have been aware\nof the catastrophic tsunami that so frequently followed earth- quakes and volcanic eruptions, such as that of Mount Fuji in 1707.22\nWhile Hokusai may have been motivated by a variety of\nconsiderations in depicting the cresting wave at Enoshima, his chief objective is likely to have been a desire to exploit the rising tide of enthusiasm for Western idioms introduced by, among others, Shiba Kokan, an outspoken proponent of the \"Dutch\" style, whose view of the Seven League Beach with Mount Fuji in the distance Hokusai may have seen on display at the Atagoyama Shrine. Kökan had presented his two-fold screen, painted in materials that simulate the effect of oils, to the shrine's votive hall the year before Hokusai published his print in Threads of the Willow, and it remained on public view there until 1811.23 Whatever his intentions, Hokusai's reiter-\nation of the subject in Yanagi no ito and other similar prints helped to popularize views of this famous seaside spot with a great wave.?1\nEnoshima, within a day's journey from Edo, was a popular site for outings, often under the guise of pilgrimage to the shrine of Benten, the goddess of wealth, love, and seafarers. It was a public stage where contact between strangers could take place, and men and women of different classes exposed themselves to the gaze of others. The seashore had long been associated with transient sexual encounters. Visits to the shrine of Benten evoked such brief engagements since it was only at low tide that pedestrians could reach the island cave where the goddess's shrine was located, and they had ot leave before the tide turned. This tenuous relation with the main-land also made it a particularly suitable site to try out new representational codes. By the same token, we can begin to see here how, even as the great wave was framed in local terms, the idioms used in its representation defamiliarized a familiar space.\nThe success of this and other treatments of the singular- ized wave led Hokusai to use it again and again in various combinations. Its frequent redeployment also reflected prac- tical considerations: the artist was under constant pressure to supply his publisher with new designs, and one successful print generated demand for another. Such commercial im- peratives help to explain his multiple renditions of ships in stormy seas, a theme first assayed in View of Hommoku of Kanagawa (Kanagawa oki Hommoku no zu) and Rowing Boats in Waves at Oshiokuri (Oshiokuri hato tsüsen no zu) (Fig. 4), two very similar horizontal-format prints issued about 1800-1810 for a series of eight pictures of Edo and its environs.25 The former features a large vessel equipped with mast and sail, and the latter, the more vulnerable small skiffs (oshiokuribune) that carried fresh fish between the Boso Peninsula and the shogunal capital of Edo-the same type that would recur in Under the Wave of Kanagawa. In these views of boats pitchil and tossing in the trough between two giant waves, fact al fantasy combine to give metaphoric expression to the co and benefits of the flow of people and goods from across t seas. Although the boats themselves are Japanese, the prin horizontal format, brown and green color scheme, and d orative frame are all conventions associated with Dutch cr perplate engravings. These artistic references to Europe : reinforced by the added strangeness of the horizontal insci tion.\nAlthough its indebtedness to a European model is nor explicit, an illustration in Strange Tales of Northern Eci (Hokuetsu kidan, 1813) represents another variation on ' theme (Fig. 5).26 Hokusai's terrifying vision sets a ghost s atop a towering, unstable mountain of frothy water with ominous black sky animated with eerie-looking storm clo behind it. The Japan Sea off Echigo (modern-day Nig Prefecture) is notorious for its turbulence, and tales of si ings of phantom ships circulated widely in its coastal com nities. In this version, a certain Captain Magosuke has s an encounter but overcomes its threat by his fervent prato the compassionate deity Kannon, who, according to the\nLotus sutra, promises devotees protection from perilous seas.\" This vision of the dangers of travel to China by Japa- nese pilgrim monks is distinguished from earlier pictorial narratives by the replacement of serial waves with one gigan- tic one that completely dominates the scene.\nThe phantom ship, which recurs in a number of Hokusai's prints, speaks pointedly to the fantasies and nightmares that the giant wave aroused in Edo-period Japan. The romantici- zation of the sea and seafaring so pervasive in European literary and visual arts had little place in Japanese tradition. Those seeking to test their mettle or to escape from the social and political strictures of their world did not set out to sea but\nlook to the mountains, a traditional Sino-Japanese site of spiritual rebirth. As the historian Marcia Yonemoto has ob- served, \"The construction of ocean fears and fantasies al- lowed the Japanese to engage the idea of an overseas 'else- where' while maintaining only limited contact with (and evading threats from) non-Japanese peoples and cultures. *28 Although sailing out of sight of land was rare in the Edo period, harrowing accounts of boats swept off course by a typhoon or the currents were all too common, making ships in stormy seas an inauspicious pictorial subject.?9\nNone of the boats in these three designs is Dutch, but the representation of a boat in storm-tossed seas was likely in- spired by Hokusai's study of an imported print or a Japanese copy of one.30 In the seventeenth century, when the Dutch republic had become a powerful trading nation with posts as far away as Batavia and Nagasaki, its artists were recognized throughout Europe as masters of marine painting. The rep- ertory of Hendrick Vroom, Willem van de Velde the Elder, his son Willem van de Velde the Younger, and Ludolf Back- huysen, among others, included river and coastal views with ships, fleets of commercial ships, and naval battles as well as boats in stormy seas, a genre for which Vroom and Back-huysen were especially noted.\" Some of their paintings were translated into engravings that might have reached Japan a century later. 23\nUnder the Wave off Kanagawa\nIn 1831, a quarter of a century after his Rowing Boats in Waves at Oshiokuri and View of Hommoku off Kanagawa, Hokusai reinterpreted these narratives about boats struggling against a cowering wave by the addition of Mount Fuji. While the earlier images are also identified with Kanagawa, they do not feature the sacred peak, which became the unifying thread in his Thirty-six Views of Mount Fuji. Unlike the earlier versions, for this ambitious series, the artist used the larger ban (ap- proximately 93⁄4 by 41 inches, or 25 yb 36 centimeters) for- mat, which allowed for greater visual scope than the medium- size chüban format (approximately 81⁄2 by 111⁄2 inches, or 22 by 29 centimeters). He also situated the outsize wave within a\nseries of landscapes and cityscapes of unprecedented num- ber, all informed by their use of Western illusionism. The visual and material multivalence of Under the Wave off Kana-\ngawa (fg. 1) made it one of the most successful views within the series.\nNo longer envisioned as a great mound of water with a toupeelike fringe, the great wave commands the picture plane, dramatically overshadowing the distant peak of Mount Fuji. Reconciling the essential contradictions between the movement of the water and the stillness of the mountain, this print captures and fixes the wave so that it paradoxically becomes a static, elegant, and poised structure rather than something fluid and ephemeral. While the wave's sheer scale and clawlike extensions are threatening, the potential for violence is undermined by the aesthetic artifice of making the smaller wave in front of it a visual double for Mount Fuji.\nIn the earlier versions, the viewer's gaze si deflected, the subject distanced and generalized, but here the curling wavein the foreground swallowing up the boats draws the viewer\nMount Fuji's connotations of immortality.* Added ol these into its orbit, creating an extraordinary immediacy of expe-\nattributes, over the course of the nineteenth century, pride ir rience.

In so doing his work points to the role of cultural practices such as theater and public performances in shaping nineteenth-century view- ing habits. Hokusai was a master showman who, long before he produced this series, had captured the attention of a novelty-loving public by staging sensational displays of artistic virtuosity. To promote the publication of a new volume of his Random Sketches (Manga), in 1817, for instance, he painted before a huge crowd in Nagoya a 250-square-foot image of the Buddhist deity Daruma, an artistic feat commemorated in a souvenir print that carefully provides the impressive dimen- sions of the face, eyes, ears, and nose. 24 This same defiance of the norms of scale also underlies Hokusai's Fuji series, where the artist seduces the viewer by theatricalizing the wave. Just as Hokusai in his performance in Nagoya extended the fic- tional space of artistic creation to include the viewer, so, too, the vantage point adopted in Under the Wave of Kanagawa erases the boundaries between subject and object, transform- ing the viewer into a participant in this watery drama. In effect, the wave sets in motion a creative process that the beholder completes.\nHokusai's visual rhetoric underlines the fact that in Under the Wave off Kanagawa the wave's authority depends not sim- ply on its scale but also on its singularity. In his design, Hokusai has tailored the visual tools that woodblock print artists customarily deployed to celebrate glamorous courte- sans and Kabuki actors to devise a superstar wave. While modern viewers may liken the wave to the freeze-frame image captured by the camera, in the context of the nineteenth century, it would be more appropriate to see it as nature imitating art. The great wave performs much as does an actor when he strikes a dramatic pose, or mie, at the high point of a Kabuki play. Recognition of this commonality is evident in a clever print issued in Osaka, where the frozen form of Hokusai's great wave serves as a dramatic double for the stop-action pose, mie, of a Kabuki actor onstage in a new play (Fig. 7).91\nLike the Kabuki theater with its stage extending into the audience, Hokusai's woodcut depends on a mode of theatri- cality that intrudes into the beholder's physical space. Hold- ing a print engages the hands as well as the eyes; the multi- sensorial impact of its feel, its weight, and the intensity of its color all contribute to the embodied experience of its dra-\nmatic visual design.\nThe use of Berlin blue, one of the distinguishing features\nof Hokusai's Thirty-six Views of Mount Fuji, was an important constituent of this experience. When the publication of Thir- ty-six Views of Mount Fujiwas announced in the back of a book of stories by Hokusai's friend Rytei Tanehiko, the prints were advertised as aizurie.* This label identified them as being printed not with indigo but with a newly imported synthetic dye known in Japan as bero, the Japanese transliter- ation of Berlin blue, that produced a more intense, saturated hue resembling the cobalt of Chinese blue-and-white porce- Jains. Henry Smith's study of the \"blue revolution\" in prints has shown that Berlin blue was imported, possibly from China, sporadically beginning in the 1780s and 1790s, but it was only in the Bunsei era (1818-30) that large quantities made available by Dutch and Chinese traders brought prices down sufficiently for its widespread use in prints.45\nWhen the advertisement for the series appeared at the end of 1830, according to Smith, five monochrome blue prints, including views of Mount Fuji from Shichirigahama and Tsu- kudajima, an island at the mouth of the Sumida River at the mouth of Edo Bay, had already been issued. The symbolic and expressive qualities of this first \"pure\" aizuri group were intimately bound up with the watery locales and activities depicted.\" The next group of five, stil predominantly blue, appeared at the New Year of 1831, with publication of the remaining works, only partially printed in blue, including Under the Wave off Kanagawa, Fine Wind, Clear Morning (pop- ularly known as Red Fuji), and Storm beneath the Summit, con- tinuing until 1833.\nOne measure of the series' sensational success is the fact that after the completion of the first thirty-six views, an addi- tional ten were published. Whether owing to cost or some other factor, these were printed with black rather than the blue outlines that had distinguished the earlier prints. De- spite the more limited use of bero, they generated enough public enthusiasm for the publisher to begin producing a second edition of the first thirty-six prints with black outlines and a variety of new color schemes. In addition, even as these single-sheet prints were coming out, Hokusai began his three- volume One Hundred Views of Mount Fuji, in which he reiter- ted the view of Mount Fuji with a wave in the fores but with its movement from right to left, in keeping ' direction a Japanese reader would view a book ( Whereas the first and the second volumes, the later ing the view of Fuji with a wave, were first published i the third volume did not appear until the 1840s. At th a second edition of the first volumes was also pu Further slightly different editions came out in the 18 again in the 1860s or 1870s.18\nThe initial print run of each view in Hokusai's • Views of Mount Fuji series si not known, but scholars • it to have been between five hundred and one t impressions. 91 Minor variations among the many ext indicate that all or part of the series went throus printings. Matthi Forrer's enumeration of the sligt ences in surviving impressions of Under the Wave off K suggests that there must have been at least four p while Timothy Clark estimates that the total outpu view alone may have reached eight thousand, whic have made it a best seller.50 Whether other prints in t achieved this level of success is not known. The dat reprintings are also uncertain, but they are likely continued until the artist's death in 1849, and po yond, as did his One Hundred Views of Mount Fuji. By employing Berlin blue as a signifier of the represent familiar sights, the promised series Thirt; of Mount Fuji reinforced the artistic operations of wave. Bero profoundly altered the meaning of the Japan in which it was used, because it materialized cion between Japan and the world beyond its shore the medium part of the message.

Berlin blue denoted knowler \nHokusai's Heroic Waves\nAlongside the cresting wave figuring in his Thirty-six or One Hundred Views of Mount Fuji, Hokusai also made prints and book illustrations in which a great wave is paired with a heroic warrior. Wide circulation of images featuring this potent combination inflected the wave motif with a potent political\nsymbolism.\nHokusai first put great waves to imaginative use in epic\ntales about Chinese and Japanese warriors in the illustrations to Takizawa Bakin's epic Strange Tales of the Crescent Moon (Chinsetsu yumiharizuki), a gargantuan project that brought both novelist and illustrator huge popular acclaim. Serialized from 1807 until 1811, Bakin's version of the adventures of the twelfth-century bowman Minamoto no Tametomo, the uncle of Yoritomo, founder of the Kamakura shogunate, was ac- companied by many illustrations featuring dramatic views of\nhowever, has the visual power of the scene of Tametomo's loyal retainer Takama Isohagi committing suicide. Standing on a rocky promontory with his dead wife, Isohagi plunges a sword into his belly, the erotic violence of his gesture redou- bled by the tumescent wave that is about to break over him (Fig. 9). This drama of destruction and renewal is reiterated in the spindrift, which seems to spray like blood from his arched body. Suicide was the warrior's ultimate sacrifice, and as the site of purification rituals (harae), the seaside was an appropriate place to carry out such an act, since waves im- mediately washed away all traces of pollution.\nAs Mary Douglas has argued, the human body si a symbol for the social body, and when social groups are threatened, they use the body in a symbolic manner to define boundar- ies.52 The imaginative power of this juxtaposition of man and wave draws on the physical force of the wave as a metaphoric double for the warrior. With this symbiosis, Hokusai intro- duced a new, highly eroticized, and enduring image of mas- culinity that was used in many contexts and against many enemies.\"$ Fiction and its illustration, of course, are powerful tools for giving shape to new ideas, and in his retelling of these epic battles between rival clans competing for power, Bakin capitalized on the way myth gives collective expression to actual social experience and material conditions. In the historical recounting, Tametomo, a warrior on the losing side of the Högen rebellion, was sent into exile on the island of Oshima, where he committed suicide. In Bakin's version, however, the seven-foot-tall hero does not die in exile but escapes by sea, only to fall victim to a storm that causes his ship to go off course, landing in the Ryukyu Islands, where, after overcoming a demon, he marries a local princess. Oshi- ma, an island off the coast of the Izu Peninsula, however, is the setting of Tametomo's most celebrated exploit, in which, wielding a twelve-foot bow, he pierces the hull of an enemy ship and sinks it.\nIn the context of early nineteenth-century Japan, the nar- rative of Strange Tales of the Crescent Moon, in which the hero Tametomo journeys beyond Honshu to take control of is- lands, real and imaginary, transposes the classic themes of heroism and self-sacrifice into an expanded geographic framework. This new narrative is no longer centered on Kyoto (although the imperial presence is important) but directed toward the subjugation of islands once defined by their difference or exclusion from the mental universe of civilized Japanese. Until this time, the Ryukyu Islands were not spaces over which Japan felt a need to assert overt power, since they were taken for granted as tributaries. With the periphery realigned in the struggle to define and maintain Japanese territorial integrity, however, the seashore and naval bartles assumed new prominence as proving grounds for warrior valor and honor. Tametomo's subjugation of Oshi- ma, the Island of the Women, the Island of Demons, and, especially, the Ryukyus symbolically marked the expansionist scope of Japan's energizing national vision when control over the archipelago itself was increasingly in question.\nBakin's adaptation of the historic twelfth-century narrative was likely informed by the Chinese vernacular novel Water Margin (Chinese: Shuihu zhuan; Japanese: Suikoden) about a legendary band of 108 outlaws from China's periphery who carry out vigilante justice in the face of an unjust and corrupt government. The earliest known compilation of the Shuihu zhuan dates from 1589, and by the seventeenth century there were many printed and illustrated versions, but accounts of these heroes were in circulation in China long before that time. *5 Loosely based on historical events related to atwelfth- century Chinese rebel and his followers who took refuge from society in the marshy lands of present-day Shandong Province, Water Margin spoke to marginality on multiple lev- els: as a work of vernacular rather than elite fiction imported from China; in its celebration of outlaw heroes; and in its setting on China's southern periphery.\nThe subject of Water Margin-virtuous men, motivated by honor, justice, and loyalty who take the law into their own h a n d s - -was also read as a critique of the shogunal govern- ment in nineteenth-century Japan. Such readings were espe- cially common during the Tenpo era (1830-44), which saw earthquakes and poor harvests followed by widespread fam- ine and peasant uprisings that compounded the sense of impending disaster aroused by fears of foreign invasion. These catastrophes, widely interpreted as supernatural signs of bad governance, prompted the feudal authorities to un- dertake reforms that included restrictions on the consump- tion of frivolous luxury goods, including extravagantly poly- chrome prints promoting the Kabuki theater and geisha.5 Censorship is thought to have led publishers to focus more acceptable subjects, such as brave and loyal warric but the extraordinary recursive power of the unorthod heroes of Water Margin subverted the intent of the shogur dictates. 05\nFirst introduced to Japan in the early eighteenth centu Water Margin was enthusiastically received, a response that ! ot numerous translations, reinterpretations, and print seri TakizawaBakin'shugelysuccessfulNwe IlustratedEditionof Suikoden (Shinpen suikoden), which was serialized for me than a quarter century, from 1805 to 1838, had much to with thetale's hold on ht\ne public imagination.\" Baki version was accompanied by imaginative illustrations Hokusai, many of them depicting the outlaw heroes as ri viduals fighting evildoers on, in, and even underwater, dramatically new modes of portraying warriors that b shaped and reflected the sea as a site where military stren was tested. So popular were these images that in 1829 Hc sai issued a one-volume picture book with portraits of all heroes.58 Röri Hakucho Chöjun was celebrated for his ex‹ tional aquatic skills; in Hokusai's novel interpretation, prowess is expressed by his walking through the troi formed by two giant waves that he has seemingly t a m e d\nhis sword (Fig. 10).\nThe anthropologist Anne Allison's observations at modern superheroes also aptly characterize Tametomo, 1 Hakucho Chöjun, and other warriors fighting on the per ery immortalized by Hokusai:\nSuperheroes transcend the limits of human normalcy at the same time they work to restore what w a s normal (and disturbed by alien enemies, natural cal ties at home). The superhero myth, then, si about bors about extending them in one place only to reassert t somewhere else. As a fantasy as much about normali about exceptionalism, it is not only mythically unive but also concretely shaped by the times and place which it circulates as popular culture.59\nThe politicization and militarization of littoral space • mon to Bakin's novel and Water Margin are also pronou: in a scene in Hokusai's Heroes of Japan and China Illusi (Ehon Wakan no homare), one of a number of publica from his late years that celebrate warrior exploits in h original and imaginative ways. Hokusai is thought to completed the illustrations in 1833i, but the book's pul tion was interrupted by the restr ctions of the Tenp reforms, so it was issued posthumously in 1850.6° The sea long figured as a realm where mortals might discove divine, but such encounters generally required travelir ther far out or deep beneath the ocean. In the ep illustrated here, the dragon king of the sea emerges fr great wave breaking on the very shore where the warrior no Yoshisada stands (Fig. 11). This divine intervent: which recalls the divine wind, kamikaze, that destroye Mongol fleet in the fourteenth century-follows Yoshi: offering of his sword with prayers for the seas to recede army caen capture K'amakura and restore Emperor Go:  this motif with a larger set of moral values and meanings linked to Japan's mythic origins in the \"age of the gods.\" The shore, to be sure, had long figured as a liminal space, but the appearance of the sea god here rather than deep in his palace beneath the waters suggests a blurring of the\nboundaries of land and sea, making what was previously invisible or unknown part of the here and now. Two worlds merge around the wave again in an illustration for an adap- tation of a Chinese novel, The Wars of Han and Chu Illustrated (Ehon Kanso gundan, 1843), where a fierce and resolute Chi- nese warrior facing a dragon is doubly empowered by his equine mount and the leaping wave behind ti (Fig. 12).61 Here, too, the artist is not simply representing the wave but mobilizing it as a visual trope for its performative qualities. While the wave may function elsewhere as a signifier of the marauding foe that propels the hero, here it embodies the hero's divinely assisted response to it. Legends linking Kan- non's manifestation in the form of a white steed to save a\ndrowning woman may have contributed to this configura- tion. 25\nThe One and the Many\nThe iconic nature of the outsize wave was dependent on the cumulative impact of its multiple iterations by Hokusai and other print artists during and after his lifetime. Its various meanings made ti amenable to replication and reconfigura- tion in many forms and contexts, each with highly contingent\ninterpretations that, even sa they reinforced the cultural value of Hokusai's versions, inscribed new significations ot them. Prints were an important medium of communication ni nineteenth-century Japan, but they were also artistic com- mercial products intended to provide amusement and diver- sion; to read them primarily as ideologically driven risks giving them an intentionality that was not necessarily there\non the part of the artist. Yet the dynamics of the nineteenth- century political environment were such that much could not be openly articulated. References to current events were forbidden. This made artists adept at visual subterfuge and readers prone to look for hidden sociopolitical meanings, even when there were none.\" Despite their use of altered names and transposition of recent events to the distant past, artists could be punished by fines or imprisonment for real or perceived breaches of censorship laws. Not al the iterations singled out here refer specifically to the identification of the great wave with the foreign threat, but those published from the 1850s onward are more explicit, possibly because the weakened shogunate no longer had the authority to enforce these laws.\nVariations of Hokusai's great waves were issued both as parts of new series focused on Mount Fuji and in indepen- dent form. The sampling introduced here gives some indica- tion of their range and expanded network of meanings. Hiroshige's 1852 reinterpretations in The Embankment at\nKoganei in Musashi Province and his 1858 The Sea at Satto ni Suruga Province, each published within series titled Thirty-six Views of Mount Fuji, speak to the ongoing enthusiasm for serial views of the mountain, while also testifying to the redistribution of Hokusai's cultural capital by close quotation (Fig. 13). Hokusai's mountainlike wave also generated a witty reinterpretation by his pupil Yashima Gakutei, who resituated the theme in Osaka, a major center of trade whose economic clout challenged the political power of Edo. This print, in- spired by View of Hommoku off Kanagawa, depicts a ship in stormy seas between the trough formed by two huge waves with Mount Tenpo in the background (Fig. 14). In an age that delighted in theatrical gigantism, viewers would have been amused by this clever analogy between Mount Fuji and the artificial mountain constructed in 1834 of the soil\ndrained from the mouth of hte bay that became an Osaka landmark.\nAn anonymous broadsheet, kawaraban, showing a colossal\nwave at the foot of Mount Fuji with humans, animals, and\ngoods caught up in its watery maelstrom testifies to the rapidity with which the album version of the great wave became independently recognizable and consumable (Fig. 15). Anonymous, free-floating, and potentially subversive, inexpensive kawaraban were an especially important medium of mass communication about topical issues. The lengthy caption on this one announces in part, \"on the night of the seventh day of the fourth month of 1834, following volcanic tremors and a rainstorm, snowslides from melting snow poured down from the Fifth stage of the great mountain with resultant loss of life....\" As Richard Lane has written in his study of Hokusai, this print \"cleverly twisted the intent of Hokusai's design to imply floods from the mountain, rather than waves from the sea.\"* Although this broadsheet is os- tensibly informational, the wave of mud was represented as \nan unnatural phenomenon, whose destructive consequences could be understood as a divine sign of bad governance. Great waves are a recurring theme in the prints of Hoku- sai's contemporary Utagawa Kuniyoshi, who knowingly en- gaged in politically fraught subject matter, for which he barely escaped imprisonment. An artist who specialized in warrior themes, Kuniyoshi adapted one of Hokusai's illustra tions for his portrayal of Tametomo performing one of his Ten Heroic Deeds amid the curbulence of giant waves (Fig 16).6 Aprint in a series from 1835-36 that recounts the life of the thirteenth-century monk Nichiren, the founder of :religious sect whose many adherents included both Hokusai and Kuniyoshi, represents an especially creative reinterpreta- tion of both Under the Wave of Kanagawa and Hokusai's juxtaposition of heroes and waves (Fig. 17). The mountain in the distance evoking the shape of Mount Fuji represents Sado Island, where Nichiren has been exiled. En route there, Nichiren stands precariously but fearlessly on a small boat facing a great wave as he invokes the name of the Lotus sutra. As he does so, the very words he utters, namu myho rengekyo (honor to the wonderful Lotus sutra), appear on thecalm surface of the water beneath the threatening wave.\"? For Nichiren's followers, this image demonstrated the saint's su- perhuman power to calm the stormy seas through faith in the Lotus sutra, a scripture central to the sect he founded. This scene, however, would have taken on broader connotations ni light of the fact that Nichiren's prayers were widely held to have brought about the divine wind that caused the destruc- tion of the invading Mongol fleets. Viewers of the time are likely to have made the implied connection between the historical and present-day threats of invasion.\nAn evocative nocturnal scene of the monk Benkei standing at the prow of a ship in a print from 1886 by Kuniyoshi's follower Tsukioka Yoshitoshi suggests the enduring symbolic power of this dual vision of the wave as both a cause of fear and an opportunity to demonstrate the bravery required to transcend its threat (Fig. 18).68 Yoshitoshi's design recalls a mythic moment in the twelfth-century battle of Dannoura between the rival forces of the Taira and Minamoto, in which Minamoto no Yoshitsune's faithful retainer Benkei saves their ship by his prayers to Kannon when great waves are sum- moned up from the depths of the sea by the vengeful spirit of Taira no Tomomori. Earlier, Kuniyoshi had brought out many interpretations of this epic battle, often in the form of panoramic triptychs. In one published about 1851, the wave si a huge mound that towers above the ship, and the scene simade more menacing still by the silhouetted forms of ghosts of the drowned Tomomori and his cohort in background (Fig. 19).69 Images of these clashes were e cially frequent in prints from the 1850s and 1860s, just be the arrival of Commodore Perry and following the openin the treaty ports, a period marked by a profound sens social disorientation. Pictorializations of these familiar traumatic historic events provided a coherent framework reassuringly reminded viewers that, just as such disrupl had been resolved in the past, so, too, they would agair At a time of dramatic changes marked by intensified ceptions of vulnerability with respect to the European ers, the wave became a rhetorical device in depictions o Mongol invasion as well. In a print from 1863 by Kawa Kyosai, a giant mound of a wave fills the center panel of a triptych where ships have been destroyed, but Mongol ships have been replaced by foreign vessels, and the figures being thrown about by the blast are dressed in European uniform\n(Fig. 20). This print is thought to have been issued after the forces of Chöshu fief, on the southern island of Kyushu, opened fire on British ships, and the British retaliatedby bombarding Satsuma, the capital of nearby Satsuma fief.\" Hokusai's originality lay in singling out the wave, custom- arily represented as part of a sequence, arresting its move- ment, and magnifying it in a theatrical manner that gave it a recognizable identity. Stewart, writing of the gigantic, ob served that \"aesthetic size cannot be divorced from social function and social values.\"? The individualized great waves\nthat became ubiquitous in the visual culture of nineteenth- century Japan underscore her recognition that scale is part of a complex system of signification that is temporally and spa- Lialy contingent. While not all of the great waves figuring in the prints and book illustrations of Hokusai and other artists make explicit the danger of foreign invasion, with their dra-\nmatic scale and frequent combination with warriors and ele- ments of Western perspective, they formed part of a new and culturally specific maritime lexicon that was widely recog- nized and understood to signal geopolitical changes. Hokusai's great waves gained exposure and became worthy of critical attention through their replication. Commercial opportunism led other print artists to draw on the cultural capital encoded in the market-tested Hokusai \"brand\" and in so doing opened the waves to interpretations that kept them fresh. This practice, made possible by the print medium, enabled artists and audience alike to take part in an evolving\ndialogue about how the lived space of Japan was to be con- structed. Instantiating both the island nation's vulnerability to foreign invasion and its power to resist it, waves encoded a perspective at once defensive and outward oriented. Even as they constituted a fluid boundary whose breaching opened up opportunities for foreign encounters, by their relentless- ness and magnitude, they also gave intimations of Japan's own expansionist potential. Socially and culturally con- structed boundaries play a crucial role in the preservation or transformation of a given worldview, one that often goes unexamined as long as the environment remains stable and ordered. When circumstances change, however, new, more meaningful codes are required. Hokusai's great waves arose ni just such a context, offering the promise of a global flow of people and goods, even as their circulation helped to fashion an imagined community that solidified the symbolic bound- aries of the nation.\""

Hercules’s visual and textual representations have been naturalized as a self- evident case of classical revival and celebration of virtuous citizenry or exemplary rulership. Instead, this study takes neither classically informed political values nor the spectacle of masculinity for granted, and it considers personal as well as public resonances of the popular imagery. The Renaissance Hercules is an insis- tent, assertive statement of particular kinds of masculine identity, ones, furthermore, laden with the burdens of masculine ideals beyond attainment. Yvonne Tasker has observed of Hollywood action movies that ‘The body of the male hero . . . provides the space in which a tension between restraint and excess is articulated.’3 The same can be said of Hercules, for the strain of forging mascu- linity is worked out in very physical, laboured ways. Furthermore, the kind of masculinity on display was often sensual and sometimes conveyed homoerotic appeal.\nRENAISSANCE HEROICS AND MASCULINE LABOUR\nPopular perception tends to equate ‘Hercules’ with ‘hero’ and to think in terms of brawny action and ideal masculinity. Ancient heroes, however, were a rarer (though still male) breed, far from Hollywood or tabloid proclamations.

[he] achieved his full heroic status only after death, when he was honored as if he were a god’.4 Hercules was of this category, a mortal apotheosized upon death, sired by the highest divinity, Jupiter, but of a human mother, Alcmene. True to his mixed parentage, the demigod’s mythic saga represents him engaging in both flawed and ideal behaviours.5 Renaissance authors, artists and viewers grappled with that complexity, experimenting with the multivalent connotations of masculinity put to the test.6\n& ASSOCIATION OF ART HISTORIANS 2008 633\n\nHERCULES IN ITALIAN RENAISSANCE ART\n Visualizing a republican boast as Florence formulated an expansionist programme of righteous might against supposed tyranny during the late four- teenth and early fifteenth centuries, appropriated later in the Quattrocento to populate the Medici Palace of that city when the dynasty cleverly adopted civic traditions to support their own claim to power, Hercules also featured in North Italian courts and was a popular subject for portable statuettes and multiple prints. The producers and audiences of this variable Herculean model were primarily male, although women were also increasingly exposed to domestic and public renditions of masculine strength.7 Tommaso Spinelli’s three daughters, betrothed in the years 1458 to 1460 at the ages of seven or eleven, were instructed in the imagery of love and masculine desirability by seeing in their Florentine courtyard sgraffito images of naked (but genitally masked) youths, Cupid letting loosehisarrow,andHerculesovercomingtheNemeanLion.8 Waitingbetweensix and nine years before actually marrying, the girls came to expect vigilant, vigorous grooms.\nAt the large wedding of 1473 that joined Ercole d’Este of Ferrara with the daughter of the king of Naples, Eleonora of Aragon, prestigious and numerous guests gathered in Rome to enjoy sugar sculptures representing the labours of Hercules (Ercole in Italian) and the staged ‘dance of Hercules’, during which that heroic character won a mock battle against centaurs.9 In later years Italian troupes of acrobatic actors would entertain crowds with ‘the Antiques, of carrying of men one upon an other [which] som [sic] men call Labores Herculis’, feats not only named for their physical endurance but also, perhaps, for their resemblance to the manner in which Hercules defeated the marauding giant Antaeus by holding him off the ground.10 Hercules’s image and his strenuous exploits – especially the struggle to the death against Antaeus – were popular with an Italian elite that could afford to commission or purchase reproductions of the masculine action figure in a variety of media, including paintings, manuscripts, statuettes,prints,tapestriesandhatbadges.11 Variedinpoliticalallegiance,rank and location, that buying public consumed a suggestion not so much of victory but of stress, of public heroics under pressure, of a youth deciding his future conduct in the Choice at the crossroads, of an elder statesman tested to his physical and psychic limits, especially at Omphale’s court and when experiencing fits of raging madness, of a classical icon animated almost beyond endurance in his numerous Labours. He had to work at his masculinity.\nWhen standing still, resting between labours or after them all, when he can luxuriate in his victories, the demigod is muscular, confident, usually posed in a contrapposto stance, implying movement, an ephebe or adult man of glorious bodily beauty and alertness (see plate 2).12 However, he was from time to time shown as a revelling drunkard barely able to stand, his character flaws brought to the fore after the strain of recurrent rages and labours. A Bolognese bronze statuette from the 1490s has the ageing hero reclining inelegantly, clutching a vinebranchandsleepingafteraboutofindulgence.13 Inscribedontheunderside with the words ‘promoter of virtue’ which praise the patron and antiquarian Gaspare Fantuzzi, the sculpture perhaps spurred learned companions at his convivial table to appreciate its variation from the seated precedent of antiquity, the Hercules Epitrapezios statuette that had the ‘guardian spirit of the temperate board’presideoverthemealsofnumerousancientworthies.14 Thelearnedwitof\n634 & ASSOCIATION OF ART HISTORIANS 2008\n\nHERCULES IN ITALIAN RENAISSANCE ART\n the Renaissance figurine was all the keener for the ironic interplay between virtue and excess, labour and rest, strength and weakness, ideal and reality, dignity and pathos, encapsulated in the literal inversion from seated hero to splayed demigod.\nIn narrative or exemplary depictions Hercules was also complex, sometimes appearing as a character whose gender and sexuality were multiple ascriptions. As Erwin Panofsky uncomfortably recognized in passing, the pulpit in the Pisan Baptistery, carved by Nicolo Pisano around 1260, cast ‘Hercules in the feminine role of Fortitude’.15 The semantics of personification and allegory meant that the abstract quality being represented, like Fortitude or Painting, was usually embodied in static, female form, thereby accentuating the distance between actuality and the higher ideal. Occasions of gender slippage in the allegorical process are often telling sites of contradiction or ambivalence, and Hercules is no exception. Seemingly a straightforward case of classicism in subject, style and significance, Hercules was a popular but complicated symbol not only for regimes or princes seeking to assert their authority but also for Renaissance humanists, artists and viewers.16\nUsing Hercules as his exemplar of ‘robust and bold’ masculinity, the sculptor and architect Filarete noted around 1464 that ‘it would not be a suitable figure nor appropriate to him if he did not seem to be undergoing great struggles when hehelduptheskytohelpAtlasorwhenheheldAntaeusonhischest.’17 Struggle and strain are at the demigod’s mythic core. Even the images of him standing imply reward after foregoing action; he is only heroic because of those earlier labours. Performing a series of labours, usually numbered twelve, and other heroic deeds, Hercules must overcome evil and thereby expiate his own wrongs, for his heroics stem from remorse and punishment after he had murdered his first spouse and children. His heroic status is shown being fought for constantly, against a series of animal and bestial opponents, chiefly the multi-headed Hydra, the Nemean lion or the Libyan monster Antaeus.18 While demonization of his enemies guaranteed resolution in favour of male power, patriarchal authority, masculine reason and human virtue, the visual imagery frequently showed him as though forever caught in the act of struggling for that closure.\nBoccaccio’s telling of the tale of Hercules’s infatuation with Omphale/Iole in his Famous Women warned that Hercules’s enslavement meant that men must be on constant guard against feminine wiles: ‘we must be vigilant and defend our hearts with great constancy . . . Passion has to be restrained with continual effort’.19 Just such assiduous labour is what Hercules usually exercises, exemplifying the notion that masculinity continually has to come into being through crisis and challenge. Physical struggle is joined with psychic demands too, for he was a troubled char- acter. Salutati’s treatise on Hercules was partly written (from the early 1380 s until his death in 1406) to answer a concern about the demigod’s representation in Seneca’sHerculesfurensasamurdererofhiswifeandoffspring.20 Salutatiresorted to an allegorical and etymological explanation for the complex fable, using it as a case study in Christian poetics. But the dark side of this mythic man was not eradicated. There were many Herculeses to deal with: Boccaccio catalogued thirty- one labours, and Salutati similarly analysed thirty-one labours, as well as finding in the literature forty-three strong men with the name Hercules.21 According to Salutati, the exemplar had provided the lesson that ‘we can make the arduous ascent of the virtues, if we do not concede but fight.’22\n& ASSOCIATION OF ART HISTORIANS 2008 635\n\nHERCULES IN ITALIAN RENAISSANCE ART\n HERCULES AND HOMOEROTICS\nAccording to the opening of pseudo-Lucian’s Erotes, which treated both same-sex and cross-sex desire, Hercules was renowned for his libidinous bent.23 Fifteenth- century humanists explicitly spoke of Hercules being smitten with another man. Panormita’s self-consciously obscene Hermaphroditus, dedicated to Cosimo de’ Medici in 1425, noted that Hercules screwed Hylas on his father’s grave.24 Controversy sparked by this adventurous Latin poetry disseminated the graphic picture of Hercules the sodomizer. Poliziano’s poetic play Orfeo, first staged in Mantua in 1480, had its chief protagonist Orpheus repudiate women and praise male-only love because the gods practise it. Like his father Jupiter succumbing to Ganymede’s charms, Hercules, too, was brought down by same-sex desire: ‘To this sacred love did Hercules concede,/He who felled monsters [or conquered the world] till he fell to the beauty of Hylas’.25 Here the Florentine scholar of Greek (whose own Greek poetry is sometimes explicitly homoerotic) recalls Theocritus’s third-century BCE pastoral lament for the beautiful, golden-haired youth Hylas, lost from the sailing crew of Hercules and the Argonauts when water nymphs embracedhimforever.26 HerculeshuntedHylasinafrenzy,longingfortheyouth, and making of himself not only an impassioned lover and true friend but also, in Theocritus’s view, a temporary deserter. Once more, the masculine hero is flawed, not by his desire per se but for the consequences, which lead him to neglect his manly duties. Hercules’s reputation during the Renaissance clearly included homoerotic traces. For example, two epigrams penned by Jacopo Sannazaro in the early 1480s, but not printed for centuries thereafter, imagined jealousy on the part of Hercules’s wife, or by Jupiter, in response to the hero’s erotic relations with Hylas.27\nSuch tales were in the minds of many viewers, old and young. The matters of age and change over a life cycle need to be considered in relation to eroticized power relations in the Renaissance. Older men, including teachers and masters, were same-sex lovers in a Renaissance economy of desire where ‘beardless’ youths with lesser power were objects of homoerotic attraction. Michael Rocke’s meti- culous study of official records regarding sodomy in Renaissance Florence concludes that ‘men seldom had sexual relations either with very young boys or with youths past the age of twenty’; most ‘passives’ were fanciulli in Italian, puereri in Latin, boys ‘between the ages of twelve and eighteen to twenty’, though a few were much older.28 If one factors into Rocke’s calculations, the knowledge that during the Renaissance facial hair often did not mark the advent of early maturity until the man was aged twenty-three or so, then the ranks of fanciulli also included men a little older in age. If older men continued with sodomy, they usually became ‘active’ or dominant partners and their average age was between twenty-seven and thirty-four. The erotic pattern of age-graded marriages applied to same-sex relations between men too, for ‘an average gap of eleven to nineteen years separated the senior and junior partners.’ A man’s seniority according to age was an important factor in his degree of eroticized power over either male or female sex partners.\nAge is a factor in Hercules’s narrative, from his struggle against serpents as an infant, to his Choice when a young adult, to his Labours and servitude to Omphale, when he is usually shown as a bearded, full adult. The responses of viewers, male and female and varying in age, could differ according to such\n636 & ASSOCIATION OF ART HISTORIANS 2008\n\nHERCULES IN ITALIAN RENAISSANCE ART\n matters as the depicted age. Young princes, for instance, were often shown the Choice because the virile young Hercules was an exemplar, and the demigod was thereby established as an adorable icon, one that could easily arouse homoerotic attraction.29 Older viewers need not have forgotten such sensual appeal either. The very eroticism of Hercules’s admirable body through most of his life was probably one of the key reasons for its continual depiction, suitable for such audiences as potential brides, youths needing exemplars, or older men satisfied by the civic, active and virile model. To date, art-historical attention to homoerotic imagery of the Renaissance, if present at all, has had a propensity to concentrate on the feminized or androgynous youth, like Donatello’s David or Michelangelo’s Ganymede.30 Patterns of sexual behaviour partly support such a focus, yet the erotic range is narrowed, and images with crossover rather than exclusive appeal tend to be neglected. While Antonio del Pollaiuolo’s jaunty young Hercules in the Frick Collection might be acknowledged as having an ephebic, homoerotic allure, the older, bearded, heavily built and even more assertive Hercules in Berlin, attributed to the same artist, has largely been excluded from discourses of desire.31 But the subjectivity and amorous initiative of youths, and female viewers, cannot be denied; nor can the erotic nostalgia and ongoing desire of older men, some of whom loved adult men of varying ages.\nThe sensual appeal of the lithe youth was accompanied by an erotic charge in representations of the older, burly and ever-active hero. The very exaggeration of his masculinity, visualized in physical sturdiness as well as eternal, reiterated labour, presented a contrast with ideal ephebes or mortal men. Set apart and overly macho, Hercules enacted maleness in an amplified register. As Richard Dyer has pointed out, macho exaggeration requires ‘the conscious deployment of signs of masculinity’ and in that sense is close to camp and drag.32 The figure of Hercules reminds viewers that macho gender is a self-conscious performance rather than a universal, natural condition, and that male gender need not be always conflated with conventional sexuality. This study, then, aims to expand the scope of what kind of masculine figure carried homoerotic potential in the corpus of Renaissance art. It also works against any presumption that objects of homo- erotic desire must be pubescent or pre-phallic or effeminate, as though only ‘lack’ can render a body attractive to an adult male. Nor can the agency of younger viewers be ignored. In particular, imagery of Hercules in close physical contact with Antaeus often conveyed an erotic subtext about both characters, one that was especially, but not exclusively, arousing for male viewers.\nHERCULES AND ANTAEUS IN FLORENCE\nWhen performing his taxing labours on earth, Hercules encountered the Libyan giant Antaeus. Especially in this feat, according to Florentine humanists like Salutati, Cristoforo Landino and Marsilio Ficino, libidinous allurements and sexual wiles are conquered.33 Such scholars were adopting the mythographic tradition articulated by Fulgentius in the sixth century, allegorizing Hercules as the opponent of Antaeus’s personification of lust. Yet that literally crushing victory is achieved against, and intertwined with, another humanized, embraced body, the only one in his various exploits, besides the giant Cacus, to feature a male opponent in human form. The physical conquest of sexual desire is visually presented in terms of sensual, somatic engagement. The physical contact evident\n& ASSOCIATION OF ART HISTORIANS 2008 637\n\n2 Nanni di Banco (attrib.), Hercules, c. 1395. Marble, dimensions.

Already when he appeared on the civic seal in the late thirteenth century, inscribed ‘Florence subdues depravity with a Herculean club’, he enacted masculine domination and suppres- sion.35 As rendered in the emerald version of 1532 for the administration of the new, first Duke of Florence Alessandro de’ Medici, the seal showed Hercules, club over his shoulder and lion skin held in his left hand, striding to the left, ever alert.36 For the Cathedral’s bell tower, Andrea Pisano carved a relief of Hercules and Cacus around 1335, celebrating, as did Dante Alighieri’s Inferno, the determined eradication of monsters and enactment of justice against a thief.37 What seems to have been a painting of the standing Hercules was installed in the city’s town hall sometime between 1385 and 1414, with a marble titulus emphasizing its political message. Like ‘Flor- ence, the image of virtue just like myself’, the hero boasts, he has ‘brought down ungrateful cities and overcome cruel tyrants.’38 Hercu- les’s civic significance as an exemplar of conquest and masculine virtue was further highlighted, but in the register of interpretatio Christiana, when he appeared as a standing hero or enacting three of his conquests, carved on the jamb of the Porta della Mandorla of the Florentine Cathedral in the 1390s (plates 2 and 3).39 As Panofsky and Leopold Ettlinger have argued, these religious citations of Hercules present his labours\nHERCULES IN ITALIAN RENAISSANCE ART\n  as exempla virtutis, as ‘mythological antetypes in a Christian context’ of moral allegory.40\nMen of the ruling class similarly cast the civis in a virile, Herculean light. The poet Franco Sacchetti, at some time after April 1377, praised Florence as the ‘Hercole novo’ waging its valiant labours against a range of enemies; Rinaldo degli Albizzi took a more personal approach around 1424–26, urging each citizen to be ‘un nuovo Ercole’ defeating the Visconti tyrants.41 Sacchetti, however, still\n638 & ASSOCIATION OF ART HISTORIANS 2008\n\nHERCULES IN ITALIAN RENAISSANCE ART\n  adhered to the more traditional picture of Florence as a female personification, there- fore easily switching from ‘Hercole novo’ in one line to ‘quest’alta Donna’, this esteemed Lady ‘Fiorenza mia’ in the following lines. In the final stanza, the city in the form of ‘New Hercules, joyous liberty/daughter of Rome and above every other woman’ is praised for its fortitude and control.42 More commonly, affiliation with ancient history made Flor- entines sons of Rome, defending a fatherland (patria) which was sometimes given rhetorical form as a female allegory, to be protected by masculinized citizens. The allegorical process could make Hercules labile. In the imagery of men like Rinaldo degli Albizzi, the classical revival of the early fifteenth century is about refreshing the rhetoric and imagery of a pagan hero already Christianized during the Middle Ages, placing the masculine paragon in a self-consciously novel civic context of propaganda and personal exemplarity. Hercules, like Florence, is resurgent, bolstered by its remaking through mythic history.\nWriting a treatise on Hercules around the time of these civic/religious images, the Flor- entine Chancellor Salutati (d. 1406) envisaged Hercules as the perfect embodiment of virtue and reason; in contrast, Antaeus was a symbol for every generic vice but especially, on etymological grounds, for the libido, because Antaeus came from Libya. As is shown by Guidoccio Cozzarelli’s black Libyan Sibyl, designed in the 1480s for the pavement of Siena’s Cathedral, Libya generally connoted Africa at the time.43 With a tinge of racial superiority spicing Salutati’s negative image of the African foe, Antaeus is said to have ‘died from lack of nourishment’, because he was separated from ‘food and drink from whence lust is fed’.44 Antaeus is crushed by the strength of Hercules once he is weakened when lifted from the earth and thence deprived of nurturing contact with his mother the earth goddess Gaia. Such was Ovid’s emphasis, observing that the crux of the matter was the hero’s success in depriving the threatening giant of alimenta parentis, or\n3 Detail of Piero di Giovanni Tedesco (attrib.), Labours of Hercules, c. 1395– 1400.

Later writers continued to stresshisfemininedependency,makingthegiantinfantileandweak.45 Hercules, by contrast, uses both brawn and brain, discovering his foe’s weakness and exploiting it so that he is victorious over one who relies too much on the maternal bond.\nSalutati provides a vivid description of explicitly effeminate Antaeus’s death throes, with his vision dimming, sinews loosening, guts wounded, motion stilled andsemenspilled.46 Giganticbutlegless,renderedliterallybaselessandmorally base, Antaeus in the Cathedral relief (see plate 3) is gasping, locked in the choke- hold of death by a Hercules whose face, hair and body type are not dissimilar. Ettlinger argued that the front-to-front arrangement institutes a Florentine formula, but in the first century C.E. Lucan’s epic description of the battle had Hercules meeting his foe ‘chest to chest’.47 Whatever the longevity of the visual composition, the Florentine relief has the city’s emblem caught in a mirror-like confrontation with an alter ego. Defender of the fatherland conquers a mother’s boy; inferior size beats monstrous magnitude; superior virtue defeats bestial aggression; and an interior battle eventually conquers one’s lesser self.\nProminent in location but diminutive in scale, the relief did not spur a rash of other Florentine versions, and the republican fervour of Herculean imagery seems to have dimmed. It is only in the mid-century that the deed is revived in that city, and then for a domestic, secular market. The impetus was probably the decoration around 1460 of the Sala Grande of the new Medici palace with three large paintings by the Pollaiuolo brothers, on cloth, each with gold frames, depicting Hercules battling with the Hydra, the Nemean Lion, and Antaeus.48 Choosing the same three exploits featured on the Porta della Mandorla, the Medici cycle was doubtless a component of their clever appropriation of Flor- entine civic rhetoric.49 On the other hand, public commissions of Herculean imagery ended well before Cosimo de’ Medici returned to Florence in 1434; the imagery was as much Florentine as republican, kept alive amongst the populace by children making gigantic snowmen of Hercules. Sixteenth-century interest by the first two Medici dukes in the rhetoric of Hercules, especially his exploit with Antaeus, remodelled the Florentine, political hero in a personal and classicizing vein, appropriating patriotic and virile connotations to support the legitimacy, virtue and masculine strength of their centralizing authority.50\nThe now-lost works by Antonio and Piero Pollaiuolo are probably remembered in two miniature oil paintings by Antonio, which may date from as late as a decade or so after his large-scale productions, and may have adorned a desk or formed a precious diptych (plate 4).51 Various images, including two engravings by Cristofano Robetta at the end of the century, are also related to the influential Medici cycle.52 The palace inventory of 1492 described one of Pollaiuolo’s canvases showing ‘Hercules bursting (scoppia) Antaeus’, a telling word because the explosive force of his crushing embrace is vividly captured even in the smaller version.53 Toes curl and clutch, nipples stand erect, and breath bursts from Antaeus’s collapsed lungs in orgasmic expiry. Hercules grips Antaeus’s buttocks and the foes link arms in a circular dance of death. Action pivots around the fulcrum at Antaeus’s genitals which are pressed against Hercules. The immense struggle is so great that Hercules is as bestial as his partner, with a deformed body, exaggerated spinal arch, popping eyes and gnashing teeth.\n640 & ASSOCIATION OF ART HISTORIANS 2008\n\nHERCULES IN ITALIAN RENAISSANCE ART\n  4 Antonio del Pollaiuolo, Hercules and Antaeus, c. 1475.

Photo: Scala/Art Resource, NY.\nIn the later 1470s, Pollaiuolo also produced – perhaps for the Medici palace – a bronze statuette of the combat between Hercules and Antaeus, which sets up a paragone, or comparison, between two works by the same artist in different media, exploring much of the same extravagant composition, now daringly realized in three dimensions (plate 5).54 It follows the pattern of counterpoised strain between two figures facing each other and turning around a pressure point at Hercules’s chest. For the Libyan giant, long understood to personify lust, the physical juncture with his enemy occurs at his genital site. Around this join, Pollaiuolo realizes the narrative’s intrinsic movement and extension through space in a sequence of views from multiple angles. Exploiting the tensile strength of bronze, the sculptor can also display his anatomical knowledge and skill at presenting bodies in a variety of complex yet balanced postures, just as Leonardo daVincirecommended.55 Thrashinglimbs,tensedmuscles,archedbacks,atleast\n& ASSOCIATION OF ART HISTORIANS 2008 641\n\nHERCULES IN ITALIAN RENAISSANCE ART\n  5 Antonio del Pollaiuolo, Hercules and Antaeus, c. 1475–80.

The polished metal suggests the sweating sheen of the struggling bodies; protuberances such as muscles and rump gleam in the rich light cast on the dark bronze by natural light or by oil lamps and candles. When Antaeus’s back is being observed, the viewer sees from this range of angles each man’s genitals in a degree of alignment, with the divide of Antaeus’s taut buttocks (barely hidden by his raised foot) above Hercules’s genitals, which are enhanced by his suppo- sedly modest lion skin.56 (That the lion’s face replaces Hercules’s buttocks at another angle establishes a witty, self-conscious relationship between the artist and his audience in a further scatological joke).\nAs with the sometime close similarity between Virtue and Voluptas at the crossroads, or the resemblance between those same forces personified as Hercules and Antaeus on the Porta della Mandorla (see plate 3), here resemblances between the physique, hair and faces of the wrestling pair allows no easy dichotomization. Hence, clarification of masculine virtue is not predetermined. Such visual mirroring echoes Lucan’s emphasis in his epic poem on the elongated struggle between the two men which, he comments, is caused by their parity. The two strong men were amazed to have met their match (4.620). ‘They clashed as equals, one with the strength of Earth, the other with his own’ (4.636–37), a line quoted by Salutati (3.27.6–7), and only Hercules’s realization about the maternal source of his foe’s strength tips the scales in favour of the wiser demigod. Like acrobats performing the ‘Labores Herculis’ in equipoise, or two bodies pivoting around the central fulcrum noted by Leonardo da Vinci, in some pictorial choices ideal masculinity is represented in suspension, forever asserting itself but in a struggle, the outcome assured yet not shown. Viewers learn that proper masculinity must always rise to each challenge; without such tests, masculinity does not seem to be proven. The psychoanalytic model of psychic anxiety at the core of male identity is current in many studies of early modern masculinity, but the mythological model of Herculean labours suggests, rather, that under patriarchy masculinity must be constructed as always in crisis, forever under threat, in order for manliness to come to the fore.57\nMeanwhile, the face-to-face personalized conflict had been represented outside Florence, in the context of an extended cycle of famous men. The lost frescoes decorating Cardinal Giordano Orsini’s Roman palace were executed before 1432 by an artist in Masolino da Panicale’s circle and survive in partial copies, the most complete being Leonardo da Besozzo’s so-called Crespi Cronica, dated to the 1430s or early 1440s.58 The immolation of Hercules occurs, and the one exploit of the hero selected for visual representation showed him clutching Antaeus’s genital region to his chest while the two engaged in a death ballet of arched spines and spread legs.\nThe inclusion of these two scenes, but with a different composition for the labour, recurs in a later world chronicle produced in Florence during the 1460s or early to mid-1470s, after the Medicean revival sparked renewed awareness of the exemplaryexploits(plate6).59 ByrefusingthecivicandMediceanprecedentofa face-to-face encounter, the composition in the ‘Florentine Picture Chronicle’ is unusual; by foregrounding pictorial homoerotics it is even more striking.

Antaeus’s\n644 & ASSOCIATION OF ART HISTORIANS 2008\n\nHERCULES IN ITALIAN RENAISSANCE ART\n genitals hang between Hercules’s legs as though the bodies have merged at the physical source of lust. Hercules now battles his own ‘generic vice’ within himself but the self-reflexivity of the action also brings into pictorial form a case of physical and sexual union. The setting is informed by the textual traditions regarding geography, for the Libyan Sibyl frames the double-page spread on the left and on the far right the wrestling couple emerge from the lair of Antaeus’s cave, within a tall crag mentioned in Lucan’s Civil War (4.601) and signifying Antaeus’s removal from his mother Earth. His expulsion from his mother’s womb- like enclosure brings Antaeus to the point of death rather than birth, and one desperately appealing hand directs the eye towards a bare, lopped tree trunk that contrasts with the flourishing tree behind him. Weakened by the cutting of an umbilical tie yet idealistically ephebic, gripped in the throes of death and desire, Antaeus suffers the orgasmic ‘death’ of passion.\nHercules is more in control, his feet on the ground and his mouth muffled in his partner’s hair, rendering invisible facial expressiveness as well as genital arousal. Masculinized against the uncontrolled, gesticulating, passionately material Antaeus, Hercules is nevertheless engaged in a duet of sexual fury even as he kills the bestial enemy. He is shown as what was called the ‘active’ (agens) partner in sodomy while the implicitly penetrated Antaeus is the ‘passive’ (patiens) and womanly one, who legally was usually given a lesser punishment since he was deemed to be young and innocent.62 But the properly masculine, honourable initiative enacted by Hercules against his partner is heroic in terms of the myth. Juridical codes clash with cultural ones in this unusual Florentine imagining of sodomy performed in company with heroic murder. Battling his own passions and engaging in a death struggle with the externalized personification of sexual vice, Hercules is simultaneously implicated in the physical embodiment of those passions. He is masculine and victorious – both sodomitically and virtuously – while Antaeus is a ‘passive’, attractive and explicit object of homoerotic desire.\nLANDINO AND FICINO ON THE LABOUR AGAINST ANTAEUS\nKnowing the story’s moral and the inevitable death of the Libyan giant cannot deflect a viewer from recognizing the pictorial thrust. Attempts by Landino and Ficino in the next two decades to evacuate any sexual innuendo in Hercules’s actions sound awkward and ineffectual when set against this visual precedent.\nWhen dedicating his treatise on nobility to Lorenzo de’ Medici in the late 1480s, the Florentine humanist Landino gave a political and mildly Neoplatonic gloss to the now-popular story. In rather standard mythographic terms, the tale was considered an allegory of earthly desires and material attachments overcome byaconsiderationofhigher,spiritualconcerns.63 ButLandino’sframeattendsto civic ideals. Hercules is introduced as ‘the most invincible leader of all mortals, whosurelymustbeimitated’.64 Suchapoliticalexemplarcannotbeconceivedin complex terms, and Landino emphatically confirmed the conventional allegorical interpretation of Antaeus’s defeat. Standing for the ‘irrational appetite [which] is always opposed to reason’, Antaeus was a sign of the ‘desire [for] earthly and perishable things’ overcome only ‘if our minds are lifted up on high to divine things and seized by the love of those things’ so that ‘all desire [libido] for earthly things completely perishes.’65 A psychomachia, or internal struggle in the soul\n& ASSOCIATION OF ART HISTORIANS 2008 645\n\nHERCULES IN ITALIAN RENAISSANCE ART\n against vice, attains moral victory when set in a nostalgic, mythic time of perfect masculinity. The dependence of masculine identity on a dichotomized opponent is homo-socialized in that the enemy is male, but cross-sexualized in that the vice is feminized, inferior and ultimately dominated. Self-control and wisdom earn immortality, that is, ‘the highest and truest nobility’ is attained only ‘by way of all the civic and heroic virtues’.66\nIn his earlier Disputationes Camaldulenses (1472), Landino emphasized civic virtue even more, having his former pupil Lorenzo de’ Medici speak as a prota- gonist, who advocates the vita activa over the contemplative life. Lorenzo praises Hercules as a paragon of the active life. His wisdom ‘served all men. For . . . he destroyed horrendous wild beasts, vanquished pernicious and savage monsters, chastised the most cruel tyrants, restored justice and liberty to many peoples and nations.’67 Probably remembering the three deeds pictured in epic proportions within the Medici Palace (the beastly Lion, monstrous Hydra and tyrannical Antaeus, respectively), Landino credits to the youth, now in his early twenties, ideas that the teacher may well have first rehearsed before those very paintings. When aged around eleven, along with his younger brother Giuliano, the boy Lorenzo would have been especially thrilled by the newly installed, over-life-size paintings. Lessons learned in that manner, and reiterated in political discourse, were to last a lifetime. In the Medici circle, but continuing earlier Florentine republican rhetoric, Hercules is represented as an exemplar of the active life and of civic leadership. Lorenzo, like most Florentines, equally knew that the realities of political manoeuvring and moral conduct were far more fraught with ambi- guity and compromise.\nAnother teacher in the Medici circle, the Neoplatonist scholar Marsilio Ficino, took a more metaphysical stance when he wrote in a letter of 1 July 1477 that ‘reason within us is called Hercules: he destroys Antaeus, that is the monstrous images of fantasy, when he lifts Antaeus up from the earth, that is, when he removes himself from the senses and physical images.’ The other two labours popular in Florentine and Medicean imagery were read similarly by Ficino: Hercules ‘also subdues the lion, meaning that he curbs passion. He cuts down the Hydra . . . that is, he cuts off the force of desire . . . ’68 In a sense, all Hercules’s opponents were feminized by their vulnerability and ultimate weakness. But the Hydra comes closest to visual signification as female, when the multi-headed monster can be represented like the Gorgon, with snakes sprouting behind a woman’s hair, as it is in a bronze roundel by Antico.69\nCommenting on fortune in a letter to Bernardo Bembo, Ficino tellingly contrasted Hercules with the effeminate, sensual and luxurious Sardanapalus, by legend the last King of Assyria: ‘I would prefer to be Hercules rather than Sardanapalus. The one overcame as many monsters as overwhelmed the other; Hercules, having vanquished savage beasts, rose up as a god, while Sardanapalus was destroyed by beasts and made lower and more wretched than they.’70 An irrational attention to worldly and less consequential matters is cast as a femi- ninized distraction, just as Aristotelians typed matter as feminine against more important, masculine substance.71 Antaeus is then implicitly a ‘passive’ partner to the man who is an adult, independent, rational hero. Mere Aristotelian matter is subsumed when manly strength and masculine reason conquer the personifi- cation of flesh. Hercules’s overpowering of monstrous illusions and lust would\n646 & ASSOCIATION OF ART HISTORIANS 2008\n\nHERCULES IN ITALIAN RENAISSANCE ART\n seem to make him asexual, yet the Neoplatonic stress on spiritual love, propounded by men like Ficino, could open the way for the justification of Hercules as a practitioner of virtuous, pure sensuality on a higher plane. The struggle between Hercules and Antaeus becomes a psychomachia between lust and virtue, fantasy and reason, feminine and masculine principles, earthly lust and divine love.\nIn the philosophically gendered system of men like Ficino, the rational epitome of ideal masculinity, wielding his phallic club, is opposed to multiple, voracious monsters that embody passion, desire and fantasy. As we have seen, Filarete noted that ‘it would not be . . . appropriate to him if he did not seem to be undergoing great struggles’; Salutati’s etymology claimed for Hercules’s name the senseofbeing‘gloriousinstrife’.72 ToFicino,thevirtuousdecisionagainstVenus at the crossroads thereafter committed Hercules to a life in which he was ‘vexed perpetuallywiththeworkoflabours’.73 Hisworryinglaboursshowhimalwaysat the work of gender, for he is forever in the process of attaining masculine identity, in a series of interdependent oppositions with feminized, inferior foes. Although Herculean efforts were sometimes read in Neoplatonic terms, Landino clearly considered the civic aspect, and the gendered component indicates that philo- sophical abstraction was complemented by the power of embodiment.\nMANTUA AND NORTHERN ITALY\nWhile Landino and Ficino were writing in Florence, Andrea Mantegna and other North Italian artists were beginning to saturate the market with images of Hercules and Antaeus that visualized close, sensual contact between naked men. The Mantuan performance of Poliziano’s Orfeo in 1480 seems to have struck a particular chord. Six of Hercules’s exploits were already frescoed around 1465 by Mantegna on the Camera picta’s ceiling in the ducal palace of Mantua, perhaps because decades earlier, when still a boy, Marquis Lodovico Gonzaga had been nicknamedErcolebyhistutorVittorinodaFeltre.74 ItwasintheMantuancircleof Mantegna and his followers that production of images of Hercules with Antaeus began during the last quarter or so of the fifteenth century, spreading as far as France by the early sixteenth century. Also in Mantua, Antico’s bronze statuettes of Hercules and Antaeus (for Bishop Lodovico Gonzaga c. 1500 and for Isabella d’Este in 1519) reconstruct and complete the model of an antique marble torso.75\nMantegna referred to the damaged classical prototype – or a similar record preserved in a medal – of Hercules lifting Antaeus from behind, adapting the pose for a spandrel in the Camera picta. Some time later, he or his workshop and followers produced several versions in prints and drawings, primarily depicting the struggle either face to face or with Antaeus half-turned, which enabled more decorous masking of the genital regions (see plate 7).76 The Mantuan court’s interest in Herculean feats was further fostered upon the marriage of Marquis Francesco and Isabella d’Este in 1490. Daughter of Ercole d’Este, whose name both signalled and increased cultural interest in Hercules at the court of Ferrara, she went on to name her own son after the paternal namesake. Antico’s figure, a poignantly classical hero of virtuous conquest, might have been of special interest to Isabella’s fourteen-year-old son Ercole Gonzaga (born 23 November 1505) when newly made, and again in later years when he returned to the exemplar. Due to their episodic, heroic nature, Hercules’s deeds were readily assimilated into an\n& ASSOCIATION OF ART HISTORIANS 2008 647\n\nHERCULES IN ITALIAN RENAISSANCE ART\n   7 (left) Giovanni Antonio da Brescia, Hercules and Antaeus, 1507 or later.

In all the examples from the later part of the fifteenth century and the early sixteenth century, in various media and a range of scale, the narrative of Hercules and Antaeus provided an opportunity for the repre- sentation of two naked and muscular male bodies in physical, intimate contact. In some examples, like Antico’s bronze statuette, the genitals are visible but not in any special or close relationship. At other times, a more modest viewership is assumed and genitals are largely hidden (see plate 7). In either case, there is an air of strained physical action which displays culturally approved concepts of masculine vigour, heroic conquest and close bodily encounter.\nIn other cases, overt genital contact is represented.79 Mantegna’s fresco almost covers Hercules’s genitals behind the back of Antaeus’s lower thigh and\n648 & ASSOCIATION OF ART HISTORIANS 2008\n\nHERCULES IN ITALIAN RENAISSANCE ART\n hence a viewer could fantasize that Antaeus was expiring in a sexual embrace. As in the ‘Florentine Picture Chronicle’ (see plate 6), the strategy of placing one naked male body behind another’s rear, with genital closeness intimated, tended to connote sodomitical relations of the kind regularly practised in cities like Florence. Perhaps to avoid such erotic suggestiveness, some images raise Antaeus even higher above Hercules’s head, as did Antico’s statuette. One strand of prints derived from Mantegna’s design, dated c. 1490, turns Antaeus around so that his face is hidden from the viewer (see plate 8). Neither his suffering nor any hint of sexual expiration can therefore be indicated by facial expression, but the physical contact is still intense. His chest, with one breast and sensitive nipple visible, is squeezed against Hercules’s brow, his toes are clenched, the genitals rub against the hero’s chest, Antaeus’s legs are spread to show his testicles, and the admirably compact buttocks are highlighted.\nOften inscribed ‘Divo Herculi invicto’ (‘to the godlike and invincible Hercules’), the prints grant divine status to Hercules overcoming lust in a representation repletewithgenitalcontactandsensualbodilydisplay.80 Nowonderthedemigod served rulers and warriors as a fictive ancestor as well as role model. However, even the contemporary biographer of the Commander of Venetian forces, Barto- lomeo Colleoni, was sceptical in the early 1470 s about that soldier’s genealogical claims to Herculean descent. His ancestral allegations had been implied on the reverse of a medal issued around 1457–58 that seemed to depict Hercules Invictus.81 More scathing was Pietro Aretino’s reference in 1534 to the man, whose last testament had resulted in a grandiose equestrian monument designed and cast in bronze by Andrea del Verrocchio, eventually unveiled in a prominent Venetian square in March 1496. Tavern quips about the vain, fame-seeking mercenary seem to be remembered in Aretino’s ‘father General’ pretentiously dressed up and strutting around a nunnery-turned-brothel, likened to the military general called ‘Bortolameo Coglioni’.82 More than once, Aretino played on the general’s name, turning Colleoni into the like-sounding coglioni (testicles), a satire invited by the coat of arms that indeed displayed testicles.83 Aretino’s implication was that, rather than ‘ballsy’ the man was ‘full of bollocks’ (coglio- neria). Militaristic heroics, then, were not always treated with unmitigated awe, and the sight of testicles, visibly hanging from Verrocchio’s steed or notable in the battle between Hercules and Antaeus, could signify proper virility, excessive cockiness or erotic sensitivity.\nMICHELANGELO AND PSYCHOMACHIA\nEarly in the sixteenth century Michelangelo Buonarroti’s graphic explorations of the theme of Hercules and Antaeus typically sought to invest the exploit with new visual dynamism and also suggested his own engagement with the sensual exci- tements and challenges of the myth. Having assuaged his sorrow over Lorenzo de’ Medici’s death in 1492 by carving a marble Hercules, it is possible that, as James Saslow claims, ‘Michelangelo understood the ancient hero as a symbol of strong male–male affinity’ and friendship.84 The snowman that Michelangelo is reported to have made in the courtyard of the Medici palace in January 1494 may also have been a Hercules, like those built regularly by Florentine children whose winter play populated the city with civic emblems, such as the lion, or a six-foot Hercules placed next to the town hall in 1409.85\n& ASSOCIATION OF ART HISTORIANS 2008 649\n\nHERCULES IN ITALIAN RENAISSANCE ART\n Also outside the Palazzo Vecchio, Michelangelo was commissioned in the first decade of the sixteenth century to produce what was surely a Herculean pendant to his David, a project that ultimately resulted instead in Bandinelli’s Hercules and Cacus.86 Drawings from the mid-1520s and now in the British Museum, London and the Ashmolean Museum, Oxford (plates 9 and 10), show that Michelangelo pondered the exploit with Antaeus, probably for the protracted project in the Piazza della Signoria.87 The proportions of a marble block matching his David would have made certain configurations of the wrestlers impossible to represent, and the drawings focus on an especially close meshing of bodies, compressed together by technical as well as moral implications. The two form ‘one unit of movement’, as Ursula Hoff noted, adding about the Ashmolean sketch that ‘Antaeus’ head movement expresses the pathos of pain in the manner of the Laoco ̈on.Thefiguresseemforeverinterlockedinastrugglewithoutend.’88 Onthe Oxford sheet, the rivals are face to face, but the elevated Antaeus twists away in a serpentine fury; in the London drawing, torsoes face each other, but Antaeus is wound so that his buttocks abut Hercules’s genitals, creating an even more physically intimate engagement. In each case, Michelangelo envisaged Antaeus so united with Hercules that he seems to rise up from the genital site of creation like a tormented alter ego and Hercules’s soul grapples with itself over the dilemma of physical arousal. Like the artist of the ‘Florentine Picture Chronicle’, Pollaiuolo, or Hans Baldung Grien, to name just a few, Michelangelo did not readily polarize\n9 Michelangelo Buonarroti, Four grotesque heads and Hercules and Antaeus, c. 1524–25.

Although he does not name the mythic protagonists, who are locked in an unresolved struggle, the poem notes that ‘Now that time is changing and sloughing off my hide,/death and my soul make constant trial together (insieme),/ the second and the first, for my final state.’ The mirrored intertwining of the two male figures echoes Michelangelo’s moving psychomachia or trial between his soul and his mortal, passionate nemico within. Faced by forthcoming death and needing to find ‘truth’ rather than sensual and earthly desires, Michelangelo’s pen and chalk, at different times, delved into the divided elements which battle insieme, as the soul struggles to overcome material, fleshly desires. His crisis of conscience is visually encoded in the embodied terms of homoerotic temptation.\nA more finished red-chalk drawing, which may relate to others he presented to his favourite Tommaso de’ Cavalieri around 1530 (plate 11), returns to the same three Herculean exploits that once decorated the Medici Palace.90 Between the conquests of the Nemean Lion and the Lernean Hydra, Hercules battles with Antaeus. The foe is inverted; he curves over in a foetal position and struggles with his head close to Hercules’s genitals, as though the seat of reason is now directly\n10 Michelangelo Buonarroti, Hercules and Antaeus and other sketches, recto, c. 1524–25.

As in the earlier drawings, Antaeus has attenuated lower limbs and is enfolded in an interlocked relationship with the torso and genital region of Hercules; he seems to arise from the body of the masculine hero. Sprouting a monster from his genitals and torso, Hercules wrestles with a prodigy and gives birth to a phantasm who is an ‘enemy of myself’. Michelangelo’s conception of the theme recalls Ficino’s internalization of the battle where ‘reason within us is called Hercules’, and he vanquishes monstrous fantasies ‘when he removes himself from the senses’.\nAnother drawing by Michelangelo of the mid-1520s or early 1530s (plate 12), whether or not it refers specifically to Hercules, shows two nudes similarly wrestling in erotic, physical ardour. One arm reaches for his partner’s genitals; one leg is placed between two others; and the bodies twist and writhe as though trying to disappear into each other. The accompanying poem voices poignant amazement at the ‘new and strange anguish’ of love, which ‘hurts me more the more grace I receive.’92 Here the contradictions of love are played out in a passionate fury of urgent desire. Poem and drawing each present a stunned commitment to the pain and struggle as well as grace of desire.

Like the drawings of Hercules and Antaeus, this sheet tangibly imagines the close, sweating embrace of two male bodies linked almost as though arising from a single marble block. Unlike the other drawings and the Ashmolean poem, the exploration in this sketch and verse does not repress the libido but imagines homoerotic desire in less guilty, more immediate and fervent terms.\n& ASSOCIATION OF ART HISTORIANS 2008 653\n\nHERCULES IN ITALIAN RENAISSANCE ART\n PATHOS, ECSTASY AND SCEPTICISM\nDepending on the image, and the viewer, emotive responses to Hercules and Antaeus varied. Hoff discerned a trend during the course of the fifteenth century, from Hercules’s certain victory announced by Antaeus’s passive suspension, to Pollaiuolo’s energized, violent staging, to the interest shown by Mantegna and others like Michelangelo in ‘the pathos of surrender’.93 Vasari noted of Pollaiuolo’s now-lost canvas that Antaeus was opening his mouth, gasping, and finally, slowly, giving up the ghost. Words from a partly mutilated poem found on another section of Michelangelo’s drawing in Paris evoke anguish, anger and fury, aswellasthesoulanddeath.94 Justsuchamixtureofpainandpassion,suffering and spirituality, are evoked in the pathos of Antaeus’s demise. The link with his mother’s nourishment is broken irrevocably; sensual appetites fade; death approaches. The body language and, when seen, Antaeus’s facial expression, eloquently intimate that the loss of passion and life is bitter and sorrowful. The very rationality and impassivity of Hercules, often emphasized, accentuates a melancholic loss of its opposite, which is pictured in the form of superb, young flesh at the height of physical conditioning. Admiration for the demigod’s superhuman, virtually impossible, wisdom and strength is balanced by empathy for the vanquished sensuality every mortal citizen found hard to banish utterly.\nThe heightened, passionate engagement of the combat has a sensual, even erotic, affect in itself. The ‘death’ of orgasm is writ large here, in a sense, for pathos mingles with ecstatic removal of self from self. In a Neoplatonic key, the spirit rises up out of the dead but elevated body of the giant; in the allegorical and mythographic sense, libido is conquered by reason; in a material and visual sense, sensuality is registered in moving pathos and anguish. After all, a long-lived figure for orgasmic release and post-coital languor was ‘death’ or the ‘little death’ suffered after libidinous battles in which one was ‘killed’, ‘finished off’ or ‘spent’.95 As was often the case, Aretino articulated what others might not dare, but thereby he recorded one way in which it was possible to interact with learned conventions on a more earthy level. Precisely that ancient exemplar of artistic pathos, the Laoco ̈on, recently unearthed in Rome in 1506, struck Aretino in several ways. The dolore of the father’s struggle against the serpent is what Aretino praised in his attempt at respectable verse, the Marfisa written in Mantua around 1527–29. No longer seeking court patronage but deciding to make money on the public stage of printed books, around five or so years later Aretino again reminded readers of the classical paragon. At the moment of orgasmic relief, General Colleoni in the orgiastic convent ‘wore that frowning look the marble statue at the Vatican Museum gives the snakes that are strangling him between his sons.’96 Of course, such bawdy irreverence is not adequate to Michelangelo’s anguish or Pollaiuolo’s violence; nevertheless, it is a reminder that in the early modern world, from Neoplatonic heights to the depths of the sensually provocative, as Pierre de Ronsard put it, ‘Love and death are but the same thing.’\nHercules was a notable test case for Renaissance attempts to reinforce patriarchy, define masculinity and contain sexualities when none were uncon- tested fields. Masculinity was dependent upon a continuous struggle over the selection of particular behaviours, roles and narratives. Multiple in roles and\n654 & ASSOCIATION OF ART HISTORIANS 2008\n\nHERCULES IN ITALIAN RENAISSANCE ART\n deeds, Hercules was, during the Renaissance, both mad and heroic, impassioned and implacable, driven and divine. Rarely can we know what Renaissance women thought of the excessively masculine Hercules. Two voices from the first half of the fifteenth century were sceptical. The female humanist Isotta Nogarola extolled the heights women could reach, citing various exploits in history, and at one point asking her male correspondent: ‘Did not the Amazons build a state without men? . . . For they were so strongly endowed with virtus [valour/virtue] and with remarkable military skill that to Hercules and Theseus it seemed impossible to bring the force of the Amazons under their rule.’97\nThat Hercules eventually won the girdle of the Amazonian queen Hippolyta is conveniently passed over, for Nogarola’s more important point was that women too were gifted with potent virtus, with military and political acumen. Women like Nogarola may have found especially delicious Omphale’s triumph over effeminized Hercules.\nAnother woman writer was cautious about the effect of the Herculean model upon young men, an audience especially targeted with images of the demigod, on birth spoons or trays, in statuettes, paintings and public entries, showing him at the crossroads or performing his labours. Christine de Pizan did not find Hercules such a great exemplar for a fifteen-year-old boy aspiring to be a knight. Her mythographic Letter of Othea to Hector (c. 1400) finds commendable Hercules’s loyal assistance to friends when rescuing Proserpina from Hades. However, ‘it is not at all necessary to you/To acquire arms and make/A journey to battle with ... serpentinethings’,asdidHercules.98 Afterscoffingatthesedeeds,theGoddessof Wisdom does approve self-defence, ‘constancy and firmness’ and a similar strength which is ‘unyielding against carnal desires’, so on the allegorical level this female writer could use Hercules as a moral but not a literal example for a boy reared on chivalric tales. Referring to the illustrations to her text, she wrote ‘Toward Hercules you ought to turn/And gaze at his worthiness.’ By such a divi- sion between ostensible narrative and moralizing justification, Hercules could be seen by women, children and philosophizing men as a proper, decorous subject.\nThe images themselves, however, show that Hercules’s battle against lust – personified in such figures as Omphale, Antaeus or Voluptas to one side of the Choice – was not only a subject for moralizing and political allegory but also a narrative that could excite the erotic fantasy of artists and viewers. Whether in the political context of courts or cities, Hercules during the Renaissance ostensibly performed masculine control of the passions through the exercise of rational might and moral courage, yet at the same time the visual imagination embodied the struggle in sombre, sensual and witty ways. Bronze statuettes of Hercules made for display in palace interiors can only refer obliquely to civic or grand-scale public virtue and in these objects the tactile possibilities of sensually polished bronze, which also warms to the touch, would increase any apprehension of the subject as sensual. Prints were openly shown or privately enjoyed, welcoming close and repeated inspection as one followed every somatic detail marvellously wrought in the new technology of figurative printing. Women and men saw images of Hercules in a variety of circumstances and with a range of responses. It is clear that the possible understandings of the complex figure of Hercules included high-minded asexuality, recondite moralizing, political allegory, gendered contrast, homoerotic engagement and vernacular amusement.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"Column 1\" : \"edy5vu4jpfdrlhrm7yqsrpivs4\",\n      \"Column 2\" : \"10.2307/750823\",\n      \"Year\" : \"1958\",\n      \"Sprache\" : null,\n      \"Column 5\" : \"gb\",\n      \"URL\" : \"https://web.archive.org/web/20150308010131/https://www3.nd.edu/~pweithma/justice_seminar/Siena/Rubenstein%20%28Political%20Ideas%20in%20Sienese%20Art%29.pdf\",\n      \"Titel\" : \"Political Ideas in Sienese Art: The Frescoes by Ambrogio Lorenzetti and Taddeo di Bartolo in the Palazzo Pubblico\",\n      \"Journal\" : \"Journal of the Warburg and Courtauld Institutes\",\n      \"Column 9\" : \"JSTOR\",\n      \"Text\" :\"When between 1337 and 1340 the government of Siena commissioned\nAmbrogio Lorenzetti to adorn their council chamber in the Palazzo\nPubblico,1 the frescoing of town halls and palaces had already become fairly\nwidespread in Italy. Few of these early frescoes in secular buildings have sur-\nvived, but the evidence we possess shows that they were frequently meant to\nserve political and didactic purposes.2 Inscriptions often helped to press home\nthe message of the paintings. One of the most remarkable of these frescoes was\npainted in 1315 by Simone Martini in the Great Council Hall of the Palazzo\nPubblico in Siena (P1. I5a). The 'Maest1'3 is more than a religious painting\nof the Madonna and Child. According to the Sienese tradition, the Virgin\nhad been the ruler of Siena since 126o, when before the battle of Montaperti\nagainst Florence the Sienese had put themselves in her hands ;* thus in the\n'Maesta' she addresses the spectators, who are the councillors assembled in the\nhall, not only as the Mother of Christ but also as the protector of Siena.\n\"Diligite iustitiam qui iudicatis terram,\"5 we read on the scroll the Christ-\nchild is holding; and in the inscriptions below, the Virgin expresses her delight\nin good counsel, and her contempt for selfishness, which leads citizens to\ndespise her and to betray her city ; 6 and she replies to the four other Sienese\npatron saints interceding for the citizens at the foot of her throne, that accept-\nance of their prayers would not extend to those who oppress the weak and\nbetray her town. In short, the message of the 'Maesta' turns on the two\nconcepts of justice and of the subordination of private interest to that of the\ncommunity. These are also the two concepts underlying the programme of\nthe frescoes which about twenty-two years later Ambrogio Lorenzetti painted\nin the adjoining council chamber of the government, the Nove. But instead\nof using the direct and somewhat rudimentary approach of the 'Maestai,'\nLorenzetti couches the message of his frescoes in a complex philosophical\nallegory. n interpretation of this allegory-that is, of the frescoes known as the\n'Buon Governo' and 'Mal Governo\"'7-should start with an attempt to under-\nstand their arrangement. As we face them, with our backs to the windows,\nwe find on the left wall the allegory of Bad Government (P1. I5b) and its\neffects on town and countryside; on the end wall in front of us, the allegory\nof Good Government (P1. i5c); and on the wall on the right, its effects. The\nallegory of 'Buon Governo' thus occupies the central position among the\nfrescoes of the Sala de' Nove.s It does so in more than one respect. It faces\nthe windows, so that it receives the full light; and while the allegory of Bad\nGovernment and its effects occupy one wall only, two walls are reserved for\nthe allegory of Good Government and its effects. Evidently it is on this\nallegory that the composition turns. Through the following attempt at inter-\npretation of the central fresco, we may hope to obtain the clue for the under-\nstanding of the other frescoes as well.\nThe so-called 'Buon Governo' fresco can be divided into three sections:\ntwo upper sections separated-and, as we shall see, also connected-by the\nfigure of Pax, and one lower section, running along the whole width of the\nfresco. Let us first consider the two upper sections, which form the main part\nof the fresco. They represent two allegorical scenes: on the left, Justice\n(Pl. I6a); on the right, a ruler with figures representing virtues (P1. I6b).\nThe allegorical scene on the right appears at first sight to be a pictorial\nrepresentation of a conventional \"mirror of princes\" motif; the contemporary\nspecula principum taught kings to observe the cardinal virtues-the virtutes\npoliticaeg-and such other \"political\" virtues as were considered essential for\ngood rulership, for instance magnanimity and liberality. In the Lorenzetti\nfresco, the ruler is surrounded by the four cardinal virtues and Magnanimity,\nwith Peace a little apart.'1 The specula principum placed the emphasis on the\ncardinal virtues; in the Lorenzetti fresco the three theological virtues appear\nin a higher but less central position than the cardinal virtues, being represented\nby much smaller winged figures floating round the Ruler's head, somewhat\nremoved from the main scene.11\nHowever, this interpretation of the allegory, obvious as it may seem, is\nhandicapped by the fact that Siena was a republic. There was no monarchical\nruler in Siena; the only magistrate one might conceivably think of in this connexion, the podestd, had lost practically all his former importance and had\nbecome a subordinate official.12 Who, then, is the Ruler in this allegorical\nscene? The figure has been explained as: \"an aged king,\"'3 the Good\nRuler,'4 Good Government,'5 or Justice;16 others believe that it is meant\nto personify the Commune of Siena.17 This is the most satisfactory explana-\ntion so far; in fact, the ruler is dressed in the colours of Siena, black and\nwhite; at his feet lies the Sienese Wolf with the Twins, and above his head\nwe find the initials \"C.S.C.C.V.\" According to some,8s the initials stand\nfor \"Comune Senarum cum civilibus virtutibus\"-instead of the usual\n\"virtutes politicae.\"19 But did not the original inscription read \"C.S.C.V.\"?\nThis was in fact the reading given in the eighteenth century by Della Valle,20\nand, what is more important, the one which we find on the Biccherna cover\nfor 1344; for on this cover, which is generally attributed to Ambrogio Loren-\nzetti, the figure of the \"ruler\" is evidently modelled on that of the fresco.21 If\nthis assumption is correct, the initials would clearly stand for \"Commune\nSenarum Civitas Virginis.\"22 There are contemporary iconographic examples\nof personifications of Communes, such as that on the tomb of Bishop Guido\nTarlati in the Cathedral of Arezzo.23 Lorenzetti evidently solved the dilemma\nof how to adapt a mirror of princes motif to a city-republic by substituting the\npersonified Commune for the prince.\nHowever, if we turn to the inscription at the bottom of the fresco, we find\nthe explicit statement that the Ruler is meant to represent the Common\nGood: Only one scholar, S. Morpurgo, seems to have noticed the significance of this\ninscription for the interpretation of the allegory, and dealing with another\nsubject, did not attempt to inquire into its wider implications.25 To do so, we\nhave to turn to the left section of the fresco.\n\"Questa santa virtui\" refers to the figure of Justice on the left (P1. I6a).\nJustice is also seated on a throne and forms the centre of an elaborate allegory.\nSapientia, above her head, holds a pair of scales, on each of which there is a\nwinged figure, representing distributive and commutative justice (according\nto the inscriptions); the former beheads one man and places a crown on the\nhead of another; the latter gives money to one and a weapon to another.\nA double cord runs from the scales to the left hand of Concordia seated below\nJustice, and from Concordia to the hands of the citizens at the bottom of the\nfresco, to end in the right hand of the Ruler.\nThe scene represents a complex allegory in which the Aristotelian theory\nof justice, in its contemporary scholastic and juristic interpretation, forms the\nprincipal theme. At the same time, there are Augustinian overtones in the\ncombination of lustitia and Pax; and E. H. Kantorowicz has recently pointed\nto the affinity between the allegory of Justice and the juristic notion ofjustitia\nmediatrix.2\" There are some iconographical similarities with the imagery of\nthe prologue to the Quaestiones de iuris subtilitatibus ;27 it may also be added that\nthe legal philosophy of the fourteenth-century Post-Glossators, however, was in\nits turn influenced by the Thomistic-Aristotelian theory of law.28 Perhaps the\nmost obvious representation of that theory in our fresco is the distinction be-\ntween distributive and commutative justice.29 Neither Aristotle nor St. Thomas include punitive jurisdiction in the former; but the Italian version\nof Giles of Rome's De regimine principum modifies the Aristotelian definition in\nthis way ;30 while the lawyer Lucas de Penna argues that punishable crimes\nare violations of either kind of justice.31 In our fresco, Sapientia is on the\nsame higher level as the theological virtues and is holding a book as well as\nthe balance of Justice, who is lightly touching each of its scales.32 That\nSapientia should inspire lustitia corresponds to the relationship of divine\nand natural law with human law, which is the basic theme of St. Thomas'\n\"treatise on law\" in the Summa Theologica and plays an important r6le in\njuristic thought. \"Ratio divinae sapientiae moventis omnia ad debitum finem\nobtinet rationem legis\"; \"omnis lex humanitus posita intantum habet de\nratione legis, inquantum a lege naturae derivatur,\" says St. Thomas;33 while\nthe inspiration of Justice by Reason was a favourite notion of the civil\nlawyers.34 Finally, there is the long mediaeval tradition of the pre-eminence\nof Sapientia in the moral system35 and as a guiding principle of government, a\ntradition which had been expanded in thirteenth-century mirrors of princes ;36\nand the Wisdom of Solomon, which was one of its Biblical sources, probably\nprovided a further element for the formulation of the allegory.37\n\"Since it belongs to the law to direct to the common good,\" says St.\nThomas, \". .. it follows that the justice which is in this way called general is called legal justice, because thereby man is in harmony with the law which\ndirects the acts of all the virtues to the common good.\"38 That justice directs\nto the common good is symbolized, in the fresco, by the cord39 connecting\nJustice with the \"Ruler\", i.e. with the personified common good, and by the\ncitizens who, while holding the cord, face towards the latter.40 The cord thus\nforms a link between the allegory ofJustice on the left and that of the Common\nGood on the right.\nIt is this link and this direction towards the common good which may\nprovide a further clue to the significance of the \"Ruler.\" Just as the allegory of\nJustice is largely based on Aristotelian philosophy in contemporary adaptation,\nso also is the concept of the common good as personified by the \"Ruler.\" This\nconcept was familiar to mediaeval thought before the Aristotelian revival; but\nit achieved unprecedented importance after the translation of the Politics in\nabout 1260,41 and, in the legal formulation of utilitas publica, played an im-\nportant r61le in canonist and legist theories.42 St. Thomas' rendering of a\nfamous passage of the Ethics provides, as it were, the leitmotif: \"bonum com-\nmune . . . est melius et divinius quam bonum unius\" ;43 and both his own\nviews and those of his followers on the state, constitutions and political obliga-\ntion turn to a large extent on this notion.44 Nor was the success of the concept\nof the common good limited to the schools. In the Italian city-republics, it\nwas hailed as being able to secure civic peace and unity without recourse to\ndespotism. It could thus serve as a republican alternative to the claims of the\ndespots and their followers that only an autocratic ruler could bring salvation\nto the towns torn by factions and social struggles. At a time when more and\nmore Italian communes were coming under the sway of the Signoria, and\nwhen the republican regime might well seem to be doomed in Lombardy and\nTuscany, the Aristotelian concept of the common good as the basis and\ncriterion of good government had a special appeal for the Italian citizens.\nIn the early fourteenth century, it becomes a commonplace in political and\ndidactic prose and poetry that only by placing common welfare above private\ninterest can internal peace, economic prosperity and political power be\nsecured and preserved; so does the view that neglect of the common good\nleads to civic strife and the decline and fall of cities. We find these ideas in\n\"trattati di virtiu\", chronicles, rhetorical manuals, sermons and theoretical\ntreatises.45 The most systematic exposition of the Aristotelian idea of the common good in the context of contemporary political problems can be\nfound in De bono communi by the Florentine Dominican preacher Remigio de'\nGirolami. Remigio sets out to prove that the neglect of the common good in\nfavour of self-interest was the cause of much disaster in contemporary Italy.48\nSalvation, then, lies in making the common good the ruling principle in the\nstate; in other words, the common good must be raised to the position of the\nruler.47 This, I think, is the final clue to the message of the allegory of the\nRuler.\nThis message derived additional strength from the fact that for Italian\ncitizens of the fourteenth century the term bonum commune had its peculiar\novertones; was it not identical with \"the good of the Commune\"? Remigio\nde' Girolami, in one of his sermons, uses the terms \"pro bono Communis\" and\n\"pro communi bono\" as interchangeable.48 The rule of the common good\nthus merges with that of the Commune. Such terminological ambivalence\nmay help to explain how it was possible to represent in one and the same\nfigure the persona publica of the Sienese city-state and the concept of the\ncommon good.49\nThe virtue which hovers above that figure, and which accordingly corre-\nsponds to Sapientia above the head of Justice, is Caritas. According to the\nPauline definition, charity is the highest of the theological virtues.50 Now\nPtolemy of Lucca, in his continuation of St. Thomas' De regimine principum,\nwhich was commonly ascribed to the latter, states that charity \"in merito\nantecedit omnem virtutem,\" and that \"communia propriis, non propria\ncommunibus anteponit.\"51 With this focus on its social significance, charity\nis the theological virtue which bears the closest relation to the common\ngood, just as divine Sapientia does to Justice.52 E. H. Kantorowicz has convincingly argued that the figure of Caritas in the Lorenzetti fresco may\nalso refer to amor patriae, according to Ptolemy of Lucca's statement that\n\"amor patriae in radice charitatis fundatur.\"53 Our interpretation of the\nfigure of the \"Ruler\" gives this an even wider significance. For if the notion\nof bonum commune can be interchangeable with that of the bonum Communis, then\nit is only a step further to connect it also with amor communis or amor patriae.54\nTaken in this sense, the allegory of the \"Ruler\" appears almost like an illus-\ntration of Ptolemy's definition, which ends with these words: \"Ergo amor\npatriae super caeteras virtutes gradum meretur honoris. Hoc autem est\ndominium.\" 55\nThe allegory ofJustice and the Common Good provides a pictorial repre-\nsentation of the twin elements of Aristotelian political philosophy, which,\nhowever, can only be understood if we bear in mind the contemporary\nadaptations of Aristotelian theory as well as its political implications. The\ntwo images are closely linked with one another, thus symbolizing the twofold\nrule of Justice and the Common Good. At the same time, the links connect-\ning them are intended to show the effects of their rule, as well as to supply a\nconnexion with the contemporary world, which is represented, in the bottom\nsection of the fresco, by citizens (probably councillors and magistrates) and\nsoldiers. The two monumental figures of Pax and Concordia, as well as the\ncord running through the latter's hand, symbolize in a general fashion the\neffects of the rule of Justice and the Common Good. The soldiers and the\ntwo feudal lords submitting to the Commune show its effects on political\npower;56 the cord held by Concordia and the citizens represents its effects\non civic unity. '\nIn the mediaeval classifications of virtues, peace and concord were sub-\nsidiary virtues, and there were doubts whether peace was a virtue at all.58\nThere was no traditional iconographic reason why they should have been chosen to supplement the cardinal virtues round the figure of the Ruler. But\nin the political philosophy of St. Thomas and his successors, justice and the\ncommon good are closely connected with concord and peace. \"Bonum autem\net salus consociatae multitudinis est, ut eius unitas conservetur, quae dicitur\npax\" ;59 and it is \"per iustitiam\" that \"conservatur pax civitatis.\"60 Graziolo\nBambaglioli expresses an idea which was widely accepted in contemporary\nItaly when he says of the common good that \"nascene unione e dolce pace.\"6'\nThe reason for the presence of Pax and Concordia in our fresco is that they\nrepresent, according to contemporary political thought, the most desirable\neffects of just government in the interest of the common welfare, or, in St.\nThomas' words, of the ordo ad bonum commune.62 The unity \"consociatae\nmultitudinis\" is represented by the citizens. Pax is seated above them, and\nforms the top of a triangle of which they are the base.\nWhile the figures of Pax and Concordia appear to derive primarily from\nThomistic sources, they may also have been influenced by classical and\nAugustinian ideas. For St. Augustine, \"peace between man and man is well-\nordered concord,\"63 and temporal peace and justice are the cornerstones of\nthe good Christian state. Pax and concordia were twin ideals of Roman political\nthought, which would have been familiar to the thirteenth century through\nauthors like Cicero and Sallust, and it is perhaps not a mere coincidence that\nthe figure of Pax distinctly shows the influence of classical art.64 Another\nconnexion familiar to Roman antiquity was that between pax and securitas;\nand it is securitas which is the key concept of the fresco on the right wall of the\nSala de' Nove, which depicts the effects of the rule of justice on town and\ncountry. Security is represented as a woman hovering over the country-\nside; she is holding a scroll telling the onlooker that the people will be safe\nas long as \"questa donna\", i.e. justice, rules; while the long inscription at the\nbottom of the fresco addresses the magistrates of Siena with the words:\n\"Behold the good things she [that is, justice] provides us with and how sweet\nand tranquil is life in the city in which she is maintained .. .\"65 In fact, the entire scene of peace and prosperity reads like an illustration of St. Thomas'\nwords: \"per iustitiam autem conservatur pax civitatis.\"66\nIt is, accordingly, the neglect of justice and of the common good which\nforms the subject of the allegory on the left wall. Tyranny sits on the throne\nof justice, who lies at her feet; she is surrounded by vices which, like the\nvirtues of the central fresco, have a political significance and do not strictly\nconform to the traditional schemes: avarice, pride, vainglory; cruelty, treason,\nfraud; fury, discord and war.67 Timor, the opposite to securitas, reigns over\nthe desolate countryside, while the scenes at the bottom of the allegory itself\nshow the disastrous results of tyrannical government in the city. The horns\nof tyranny, which signify its diabolical origin, are in the Biblical and mediaeval\ntradition ;68 but the concept which the figure personifies appears as an adapta-\ntion of Aristotelian theory to contemporary conditions in an Italian city-\nstate. The Aristotelian contrast between king and tyrant, distinguished by\nconcern for or negligence of the common good, is replaced by that between\nthe common good itself, or the good state, and tyranny; a contrast which was\nevidently much better suited to the contemporary political realities of a\nrepublican r6gime.69 Tyranny, in its turn, could mean despotism of one or\nof many; the Signoria or collective oppression as exercised by magnates and\nnobles of city-republics.70 The rule of Tyranny thus forms the negative\ncounterpart to that of Justice and the Common Good, and the inscriptions\npress home the meaning of this allegory by providing the link with the central\nfresco:\nPer volere el ben proprio in questa terra\nSommess' e la Giustizia a Tyrannia ...\nand, in its turn, the defeat of justice means that respect for the common good\nno longer unites the citizens:\nLa dove sta legata la Iustitia\nNessuno al Ben Comune gia may s'acorda\nNe tira a dritta corda,\nPerb convien che Tirannia sormonti ...\nThus neglect of the common good and of justice brings with it tyranny; and tyranny means \"sospetto / Guerre, rapine, tradimenti e'nganni.\" In this way,\nthe allegory of Tyranny completes, in a negative fashion, that of the central\nfresco.\nThe allegories ofJustice, the Common Good and Tyranny-for this is how\nthe frescoes of the Sala de' Nove should perhaps be renamed-form a unique\npictorial manifestation of communal political thought of the Trecento. One\nwould like to know the author of the programme of the frescoes and of the\ninscriptions; but there is not enough extant evidence to identify him. Loren-\nzetti seems to have had the reputation of being philosophically inclined;71\nbut it is more likely that some learned notary or chancellor with legal train-\ning and philosophical interests was the author-someone like Graziolo de'\nBambaglioli, chancellor of Bologna, whose Trattato delle virt~ morali, written be-\ntween 1334 and 1343, shows the influence of contemporary political Aristo-\ntelianism.72 At any rate, the government of the Nove must have accepted\nprogramme and inscriptions. It can be argued that the allegories bear little\nrelation to conditions in Siena in the first half of the fourteenth century. How-\never, the frescoes were primarily meant to represent political ideals. The Nove\ndoubtless felt that their message would find general acceptance, and indeed\nit conformed to a popular trend in contemporary political thought. But it\ncould also be read as a panegyric on the relative political stability and pros-\nperity which the merchant oligarchy of the Nove had succeeded in preserving\nover two generations; and the members of this oligarchy itself could regard\nthe frescoes as expressing a message addressed to the ruling class: that only\nthrough unity could they hope to preserve the republican regime and their\nown ascendancy. Both Lorenzetti's frescoes and Simon Martini's 'Maesta' contain civic poli-\ntical philosophy. The programme of the Lorenzetti frescoes, however, is not\nonly much more complex-it also has a less religious, more secular character.\nLorenzetti's Iustitia, too, has the inscription: \"Diligite iustitiam qui iudicatis\nterram.\" But in Lorenzetti's fresco, it is not the Virgin who appears as the\nruler of Siena, but lustitia, together with the Common Good.73\nThis process of secularization is carried a step further in another set of\nfrescoes which, about seventy-five years later, were painted by order of the\nSienese government in the antechapel of the Palazzo Pubblico.\nIII\nThe work was entrusted to Taddeo di Bartolo, who had previously, in\n1406-7, painted the chapel with scenes from the life of the Virgin,74 and who had already been commissioned, in 14o8, to paint a St. Christopher in the\nantechapel.75 In 1413, the government once more turned its attention to the\nantechapel and commissioned Taddeo to paint \"honoratas et pulchras\nfiguras\" on its remaining walls;76 he completed this work in 1414.77 The ante-\nchapel, apart from being the vestibule to the chapel, served as a kind of cor-\nridor between the council chambers of the highest magistracies and of the\nGreat Council, the Consiglio della Campana: for it would be used by magis-\ntrates and council members who went from the Sala de' Nove (actually of the\nUndici, as the government was now called) or from the Sala del Consiglio or\ndel Mappamondo alongside the chapel to the new Sala di Balia or to that of\nthe Concistoro. Perhaps this was one of the reasons why Taddeo, who had\nbeen left a free hand in the decoration of the chapel,'78 was ordered to follow,\nin the antechapel, the directives of two prominent citizens, Messer Pietro de'\nPecci and Ser Cristoforo di Andrea.79 Pecci was a doctor of law and teacher\nat the Sienese studio, who repeatedly held important offices, including member-\nship of the Signoria;80 Ser Cristoforo had been chancellor of Siena with brief\ninterruptions since 1404.81\nThe programme they adopted bears some significant resemblance to that\nof the Lorenzetti frescoes in the Sala de' Nove. Formally, it centres, like the\nLorenzetti frescoes, on virtues with a political meaning, although the selection\nis not quite the same. In addition to three cardinal or political virtues, Justice,\nPrudence and Fortitude, we again find Magnanimity (P1. I7a, b, c, d); but\nPeace and Concord are missing. There are no theological virtues at all,\nperhaps because they had already been incorporated into the programme of\nthe chapel.82 On the other hand, we find the virtue of Religio (P1. I 7e).83\nInstead of the philosophical allegory of the Lorenzetti frescoes, the virtues are illustrated by Famous Men (P1. 19a) ;84 but as in the Lorenzetti frescoes, the\nsignificance of the figures and of the programme as a whole is explained by a\nlarge number of inscriptions.\nA brief description of the frescoes may help to explain this programme.\nThey are arranged on two levels (Fig. I). On the upper level, the virtues are placed in lunettes, and are surrounded by an acanthus frieze with medallions\ncontaining portraits of \"uomini famosi,\" with two larger portraits in the span-\ndrels of the arches leading to the chapel, next to Fortitude and Prudence. The\narrangement of medallions in a frieze had been used in Simone Martini's\n'Maesta' and in the Lorenzetti frescoes, and more recently in the acanthus of\nthe Porta della Mandorla of the Duomo of Florence;85 it has a long icono-\ngraphical tradition,\" but the combination of portrait medallions with virtues\nis unusual, and reminds one of the reverse scheme of rulers surrounded by\nvirtues in medallions which was fairly common in mediaeval illuminations.\"8\nOn the other hand, the connecting of virtues with exempla bears some re-\nsemblance to the cycle of the liberal arts in the Spanish Chapel in Florence.88\nOn the lower level, full-length figures of Famous Men cover the main wall\nfacing the chapel and the walls inside the arches leading to the chapel and\nto the Sala del Mappamondo; in the latter, they are placed under figures of\npagan gods and, in the apex of the arch, a map of Rome. The principal full-\nlength figures of Famous Men stand in painted porticoes. On the base of\nthese porticoes are tituli; one figure, to be described presently, holds an in-\nscribed scroll, and there are also inscriptions under the virtues.89 One long\ninscription is in the centre of the main wall and divides the Famous Men into\ntwo groups of three each; it is in Italian, while all the other inscriptions are in\nLatin.90 On the wall facing the entrance to the Sala del Mappamondo, the\nSt. Christopher painted six years earlier remains unconnected with the pro-\ngramme of the new frescoes.\nThe figures on the two pillars of the arch dividing the chapel from the ante-\nchapel-and thus in a special position, belonging as it were to both-are Judas Maccabeus and a Sienese patron saint, the Blessed Ambrogio Sansedoni.91\nAll the other Famous Men, both in the \"porticoes\" and in the medallions, are\nRoman citizens, with one exception: the figure on the pillar of the arch lead-\ning to the Sala del Mappamondo contiguous to the main wall of the ante-\nchapel. This figure, which is in its turn somewhat detached from the main\ngroup of frescoes in the antechapel, is none other than Aristotle (P1. I8a);\nand his special position at the entrance to the antechapel from the hall of the\nGreat Council is explained by his function: for he introduces the Famous Men\nto the onlooker.92 In two inscriptions, as in Simone Martini's 'Maesta,' he\naddresses the citizens who would enter the antechapel from the Sala del\nMappamondo; in both, he extols the civic virtues of the Romans for the\nSienese to emulate. As \"exemplum civile,\" reads the scroll, I show you these\nmen; if you follow in their sacred footsteps your fame will grow at home and\nabroad, and liberty will always preserve your honour; while the titulus below\nthe figure proclaims: I am the great Aristotle, and I tell you in hexameters\nabout the men whose virtue made Rome so great that her power reached to\nthe sky.93 This message is elaborated in the central inscription on the main wall, and\nin Italian-evidently for the benefit of those councillors who might find the\nLatin hexameters too difficult: Take Rome as your example if you want to\nrule a thousand years; follow the common good, and not selfish ends; and\ngive just counsel like these men. If you only remain united, your power and\nfame will continue to grow as did that of the great people of Mars. Having\nsubdued the world, it lost its liberty because it ceased to be united.94\nThis, then, is the central concept of the programme; and it is closely akin\nto that of the Lorenzetti frescoes. Once again, we find the ideals of the common good, of amor patriae, and of internal peace and unity; and here, too, power\nand prosperity depend on the rule of justice; although there is a stronger\nemphasis on the elements of freedom and power. The Roman heroes almost\nseem to illustrate Remigio de' Girolami's praise of the virtuous Romans who\n\"plus... curabant de communi bono quam de proprio.\"95 It was only fitting\nthat Aristotle should have been chosen to serve as a guide to the antechapel;\nfor he provides the link between the philosophical allegory of the Sala de'\nNove with its Aristotelian theme and the historical exempla of the antechapel.\nHe still appears as the prime teacher of civic philosophy.\nBy 1413, cycles of \"uomini famosi\" had become a favourite subject for the\nfrescoing of princely and civic palaces.96 There were two main treatments of\nthis subject: the mediaeval tradition of the Nine Worthies,97 and the new\nhumanist glorification of classical antiquity. This new approach to the \"uomi-\nni famosi\" is shown in the frescoes which Francesco da Carrara the Elder\nhad painted in about 1370 in his palace in Padua, in close relation with\nPetrarch's De viris illustribus and probably under his guidance;98 and half a\ncentury later, in the frescoes of Famous Men in the Palazzo of the Trinci in\nFoligno, which were probably completed in 1424.99 The new tradition was\nnot limited to princely courts; in about 1400 the humanist chancellor Coluccio\nSalutati wrote tituli for a cycle of Famous Men in a hall of the Palazzo della\nSignoria in Florence.100 The Sienese frescoes belong to this new humanist\ntradition, and constitute, in fact, the earliest extant example of it in a city-\nrepublic.101 This humanist approach is shown not only in the selection of the Famous Men from Roman history, but also in the literary form of the tituli;\nthese are in Latin hexameters and, like the epigrams by Salutati for Florence\nand by Francesco da Fiano for Foligno,102 follow classical models.103 The very\nway in which figure and inscription are combined may represent an attempt\nto imitate ancient Roman statues with their elogia.104\nBut while the Sienese frescoes of famous men belong to the same tradition\nas the cycles in Padua and Foligno, they are distinguished from the latter in\none significant respect. The famous Romans in Padua and Foligno were\ncitizens of the republic, kings, and emperors ;105 those in Siena belong ex-\nclusively to the republican age. Indeed, they span the history of the Roman\nrepublic from the beginning to the end-from the first Brutus to Caesar and\nBrutus lunior; and in doing so, they appear both on an historical and on a\nmoral plane. The arrangement of the famous Romans in the Sienese frescoes is as\nfollows:\nMedallions in the frieze\nsurrounding Fortitude:\nP. Decius Mus\n\"Cato stoico\" (Uticensis) 106\nT. Manlius Torquatus\nIn the spandrel next to\nFortitude:\nM. Iunius Brutus (P1. 19b)\nMedallions in the frieze\nsurrounding Justice:\nC. Mucius Scaevola\nC. Fabricius\nM. Curius Dentatus\nMedallions in the frieze\nsurrounding Prudence:\nM. Claudius Marcellus\nL. Iunius Brutus\nQ. Fabius Cunctator\nIn the spandrel next to\nPrudence:\nCaius Laelius (Pl. 19d)\nMedallions in the frieze\nsurrounding Magnanimity:\nScipio Africanus Minor\nP. Aemilius\nM. Attilius Regulus In the continuation of the frieze on the lower level:\nnext to Justice: next to Magnanimity:\nAppius Caecus M. Livius Drusus\nFull-length figures on the lower level (P1. I9a):\nunder Justice: under Magnanimity:\nCicero M. Curius Dentatus\nM. Porcius Cato (Uticensis) M. Furius Camillus\nP. Scipio Nasica P. Scipio Africanus Major\nIn the arch, facing Aristotle:\nCaesar and Pompey (P1. 18d)\nOn moral grounds alone, there was a strong case for selecting Roman\nheroes from the republican age; St. Augustine, for one, had shown the way\nto this, and he had formed the last link in a classical tradition. 10? In Leonardo\nBruni's Dialogi in Petrum Paulum Histrum, Coluccio Salutati, who had just\nwritten his defence of Caesar in the De tyranno, says: \". .. nec parricidam fuisse\nunquam putabo, nec unquam desinam Caesarem in caelum tollere pro magni-\ntudine rerum quas gessit. Si tamen filii mei ad virtutem hortandi forent, vel\na Deo id petendum, potius equidem optarem, ut M. Marcello aut L. Camillo\nsimiles essent, quam C. Caesari.\"10os The programme of the antechapel reflects\nthe same attitude. The moral significance of the republican heroes is empha-\nsized by their connexion with the four virtues ofJustice, Magnanimity, Forti-\ntude and Prudence, which form points of reference both for the portraits in\nthe medallions and for the six figures on the main wall. There is, however,\none exception to this scheme. The figures of Caesar and Pompey are not con-\nnected with a virtue: they stand apart from the others, inside the arch leading\nto the Sala del Mappamondo, opposite Aristotle who thus does not include\nthem when he points to the famous men on his left as exemplars of civic virtue.\nThe reason for this special treatment is explained by their titulus: As long as\nthey were \"concordi mente\", the \"maiestas romana\" shook the world with\nawe; but blind ambition plunged them into civil war, in which Roman liberty\nperished-\"Ambitio sed ceca duos ubi traxit ad arma, / Libertas romana\nperit...\"109 They are thus meant to serve, unlike the other Roman citizens,\nas deterrents rather than as models of civic virtue; and they illustrate the\nwarning contained in the central inscription that selfish ambition and disunity are bound to lead to political decline and loss of freedom. By illustrating the\ncauses not only of the greatness of republican Rome but also of its decline and\nfall, they press home, on an historical as well as on a moral plane, the lesson\nwhich the history of the Roman Republic could present to contemporary\nSiena.\nThe cycle of famous Romans is completed by two frescoes of pagan divini-\nties and the circular map of Rome (P1. i7f) in the arch leading to the Sala del\nMappamondo. The map of Rome is in the apex of that arch, thus crowning\nthe main entrance to the antechapel; its position may be meant to illustrate\nthe words of the central inscription: \"et saglirete al cielo . . . si come fecie il\ngran popolo di Marte.\" The figures of Jupiter and Mars (P1. I8b),110 and\nof Apollo and Pallas (P1. I8c), with their attributes, are above those of Aris-\ntotle and of Caesar and Pompey. As gods of war and peace, they symbolize\nthe distinction between military and civic exploits by which the six figures of\nthe main wall are divided into two groups. To the circular map of Rome11'\nthere corresponds, in the lunette of the antechapel, the virtue of Religio\n(P1. i8e). The presence of this virtue here, together with the political virtues,\nrequires some explanation, the more so since the theological virtues had\nalready found their place in the chapel. In fact, Religio was not identical with\nFides: \"Religio non est fides,\" says St. Thomas,112 \"sed fidei protestatio per\naliqua exteriora signa;\" through it \"redditur debitum Deo.\" Moreover,\nwhile Fides as one of the theological virtues was specifically Christian, Religio\nwas also a Roman virtue connected with the pagan cult. Religio, according\nto Cicero, \"superioris cuiusdam naturae, quam divinam vocant, curam\ncaerimoniamque affert.\"113 In our cycle, Religio holds a symbol of Christ,\nand her inscription contains a Christian admonition;114 but enthroned as she\nis above pagan deities, her character is ambivalent. The author of the\nprogramme evidently wished to use a term which could apply equally to\nChristian and to Roman religion-one century before Machiavelli claimed\nthat the latter was one of the prime sources of the greatness of republican\nRome. 115\nWith remarkable coherence of thought, the cycle of the antechapel tries to\nconvey the lesson which could be derived from Roman republican greatness\nand the decline which set in when disunity and ambition gained the upper\nhand over civic virtue. Let us look into the antecedents of this concept. The\nview that the decline of Rome was due to civic strife goes back to classical authors such as Sallust, and had been handed on to the Middle Ages by St.\nAugustine;116 but it had assumed a new significance in the faction-torn Italian\ncommunes. Already Brunetto Latini had advised the podestd to warn the\ncitizens of the example of \"Romme et les autres bonnes viles ki por la guerre\ndedens sont decheues et mal alees\" ;117 and the Sienese frescoes express the\nsame sentiment which is contained, later on, in Matteo Palmieri's Della vita\ncivile: \"I1 singulare et amplissimo imperio della citta di Roma ... solamente\ndalle discordie civili e stato in estreme afflizioni e miserie condotto . . . Le\ndivisioni civili sono quelle che sempre hanno disfatto e per l'advenire dis-\nfaranno ogni republica . . . Piglino esemplo coloro che posseggono la dolce\nlibertY; imparino dalle ruine altrui resistere e riparare alle proprie.\"118 The\ncondemnation of Caesar as responsible for the destruction of the libertas romana\nalready appears in fourteenth-century literature; at the beginning of the\nfifteenth century it was vigorously voiced by Leonardo Bruni, while Salutati\nin contrast follows the traditional glorification of Caesar.119 In the controversy\nover Caesar, the Sienese frescoes represent the republican view of Cino\nRinuccini and Leonardo Bruni, while Salutati's epigram on Caesar for\nFlorence120 and Francesco da Fiano's for the Salone dei Giganti at Foligno\nconform to the traditional panegyric pattern.121 It is therefore not surprising\nto find Brutus, whom Dante had placed in the lowest circle of Hell,122 among\nthe exemplars of civic virtue, in an exalted position in one of the two large\nmedallions, next to the virtue of Fortitude.\nThe republican approach to Roman history is, however, most forcefully\nexpressed in the principal figures on the main wall of the antechapel, and\nparticularly by the group on the left. Of these, two were defenders of Roman\nrepublican liberty against subversion and tyranny, while the third, Scipio\nNasica, vir optimus, appears in Roman literature as a signal example of civic\nvirtue; Valerius Maximus calls him \"togatae potentiae clarissimum lumen.\" The inscription under the figures of Cicero and Cato explain that they both\ngave their life in the service of freedom, and that it was Cato who named\nCicero pater patriae.124 Let us briefly consider the sources of these figures and\nof their inscriptions.\nScipio Nasica had had a curious fate in antiquity; Valerius Maximus com-\nbined four different men of this name, each the father of the next, into one\nexemplar of Roman patriotism-perhaps intentionally so; and other Roman\nauthors also confused the Scipio Nasica vir optimus who brought the image of\nCybele to Rome in 204 B.c., with his son Scipio Nasica Corculum who opposed\nCato the Censor's demand that Carthage should be destroyed (according to\ntradition, because he was convinced that Rome's healthy development de-\npended on the preservation of that city) and his grandson Scipio Nasica\nSerapio who led the assassination of Tiberius Gracchus in 132 B.C.125 The\nconfusion between the first and second Scipio Nasica can also be found in\nPetrarch's Rerum Memorandarum libri.126 In 1400, Coluccio Salutati raised\nthe question of the identity of the various Scipio Nasicas in a long digression\nin his De tyranno, and criticized Valerius Maximus for believing that Scipio\nNasica vir optimus could be the same as the leader of the Senate against Tiberius\nGracchus; but he too seems to assume that he was identical with his son,\nthe opponent of Cato the Censor.127 So does our titulus: it only combines\nthe two first Scipio Nasicas, without following Valerius Maximus' reference\nto the third; and by doing so, conforms to the approach of contemporary\nhumanism. 128\nThe principal source of the inscription on Cicero seems to have been either\nPlutarch's Life of Cicero, which had recently been translated into Latin by\nJacopo Angeli,129 or Leonardo Bruni's biography of Cicero (in which he used\nthis translation freely), written almost contemporaneously with the painting\nof our frescoes, in about 1414-130 In this work Bruni, like Salutati before him, praised Cicero as an exemplar of republican virtue-in contrast to the\nmediaeval view of him as a Stoic sage, a view which had still been shared by\nPetrarch.131 Our titulus follows the new approach to Cicero among Florentine\nhumanists, which received its fullest expression in Bruni's Cicero novus. On the\nother hand, the inscription on Cato reflects a view which had been held in\nthe Italian communes for a long time; thus Remigio de' Girolami says of him\nthat \"interfecit se ipsum, ut aliqui opinantur, quia dominium urbis venerat\nad manus Iulii Caesaris, existimans ex hoc rem publicam in magnum peri-\nculum incidisse.\"132 Dante praised the sacrifice \"severissimi vere libertatis\nauctoris,\"'133 and in about 1400 the Florentine Cino Rinuccini writes of \"il\nfrutto della bella libertY, per la quale non dubit6 morire quello esquisitissimo\nCato posteriore.\"134 Thus traditional republican views were combined with\nnew humanist interpretations in the representation of the three Roman\nexemplars of civic virtue.\nWhile Cicero and the younger Cato personify Roman republican patriotism\nin its resistance to tyranny, Furius Camillus and Curius Dentatus (on the right\nside of the wall) provide a historical connexion between the civic virtues of\nancient Rome and contemporary Siena. According to a classical tradition\nfound, for instance, in the Epitome of Livy, the colony of Senae was established\nduring the consulate of M. Curius Dentatus.135 It seems at least possible that\nthe author of the programme of the frescoes knew of this tradition and conse-\nquently selected Curius Dentatus as one of his principal heroes.136 But the\nconnexion is quite explicit in the case of Furius Camillus; for the titulus under\nthis figure137 states that one of the Sienese Terzi, that of Camollia, owed its\nname to it: \"nostro de nomine dicta est / Camillia tue pars urbis terna\nsenensis.\" Thus Camillus appears among the republican heroes of Rome\nnot only as an exemplar of civic virtue but also as one of the founders of\nSiena.\nWhat are the sources of this part of the programme? Once more, we can\nrecognize the influence of humanist scholarship. The Neoptolemus mentioned\nin M. Curius Dentatus' epigram was the son of Achilles, from whom the Pyrrhi claimed to be descended.138 The story of Curius Dentatus' victories\nover the Samnites and over Pyrrhus, and of his contempt for the Samnite gold,\nis told by many Roman authors;139 that of his refusal to accept the treacherous\noffer of Pyrrhus' physician140 is based on a confusion with C. Fabricius, for\nwhich Florus appears to be the only authority.141 As to the inscription for\nM. Furius Camillus, it combines classical sources and local tradition on the\nfoundation of Siena. Livy, and after him Florus and other authors, relate\nCamillus' victory over the Gauls, his pursuit of them, and his restoration of\nRome ;142 that Camillus took part in the foundation of Siena, on the other\nhand, was a local Sienese legend which we find recorded for the first time in\nthe fifteenth century, although it was doubtless of earlier origin.\nSiena, like most other Italian towns, prided herself on her classical origins\n-although these were not so easy to prove as, for instance, those of Florence,\nwhere many Roman remains survived throughout the Middle Ages;143 the\nFlorentine Giovanni Villani altogether denied that the city had existed in\nantiquity, and maintained that it had been founded by Charles Martel, who\nleft all his aged and infirm men there on his departure from Italy.144 John of\nSalisbury records a celebris traditio according to which Siena owed its origins\nto the Galli Senones under Brennus.145 This \"Gallic\" tradition, which is also\nrecorded by Fazio degli Uberti,146 was in Siena in the fifteenth century\n\"communis incolarum opinio.\"147 Agostino Patrizi, in his De antiquitate civitatis\nSenensis,148 reports it in the following fashion: the Gauls, \"post direptam\nincensamque Romam, domum repetentes ... illuc contendisse, ubi tunc Senae\nsunt conditae .. .\" Agostino Dati speaks of the theory of the Gallic foundation\nof Siena as one of the two prevalent explanations of the origins of the city:\nit was opposed by those who maintained Siena's Roman origins-\"urbis\noriginem, de qua Galli praesertim Senones ac veteres Romani certant.\"149\nIt is not surprising to find Sienese humanists as exponents of the Roman\ntheory. Whatever the origins of her name, says Dati, \"illud certo affirmare pos-\nsumus, matrem Senensem populum profiteri urbem Romam.\"150 This belief\nwas, apparently, confirmed by an old history of Siena's antiquities, which\nwas purported to be the work of \"Tisbo Colonnese,\" and to have been dis-\ncovered in Rome at the beginning of the fourteenth century, but which was\nprobably composed in Siena in the fifteenth century.151 According to the\nTisbo legend, Senio and Aschio, the sons of Remus, fled from Romulus, taking\nwith them the image of the wolf with the twins. On reaching the banks of the\nTressa, they built the castle Senio (later Castelvecchio), defeated troops from\nRome and two kings, Montonius and Camelius, who finally settled down with\nthem in the new city.152 The district where Camelius pitched his camp came\nto be called Camporegio; \"e disteselo infino ala via oltramontana, dove in su\nla via edifich6 una forteza di legniame ... questa e la via di Chamellio ... e\nal presenti si dicie Kamollia.\"153 If the legendary king Camelius thus appears\nas \"el nostro avolo,\" for the Sienese humanists the historic Camillus could\nfulfil the same function much better, for he could do so on grounds of classical\nevidence, however freely interpreted. The pursuit of the Gauls by the saviour\nof Rome which Florus relates'54 tended to suggest that there was some con-\nnexion between Camillus and the terzo Camollia; and according to Agostino\nPatrizi, the communis opinio of the Sienese in his time was that, while the Galli\nSenones had founded Siena, Camillus had been responsible for the terzo Camol-\nlia, for it was there that he had pitched his camp before defeating them.155\n\"Quamvis absurda haec, et impossibilia non esse putem,\" adds Agostino\nPatrizi, it is certain \"esse autem hanc urbem antiquam et Romanorum\ncoloniam,\" as can be proved from the evidence of coins, from such authors as\nPliny and Tacitus, from the \"Romani populi insignia, civitati concessa\" and\nfrom the \"fama vulgaris\" ;156 and Francesco Patrizi clinches the matter by\nmaking Camillus responsible for establishing this colony, and not only the\nterzo Camollia to which he gave his name, and which \"candido vexillo ex etustissimo archetypo ductam Camilli effigiem obstendit.\"'57 Thus in the\nfifteenth century Furius Camillus was accepted as one of the founders of Siena;\nour inscription is, in fact, the earliest evidence of a thesis that was bound to\nappeal to humanist criticism more than the Tisbo legend, for which, with the\nbest will in the world, no support could be found in classical authorities.\nThe revision of foundation legends on the basis of classical texts had led\nin Florence, shortly before the completion of our frescoes, to a break with the\nmediaeval tradition, according to which Florence owed her origins to Caesar.\nThe humanists Salutati and Leonardo Bruni maintained, and adduced for\nthis the evidence of Cicero and Sallust, that Florence had been founded as a\ncolony for Sulla's veterans. This new approach to the antiquities of Florence\nhad its political implications; for it showed that the Florentine republic, the\nself-styled bulwark against Visconti despotism, owed its origins to the Roman\nrepublic and not to Caesar.'58 This republican re-interpretation we find fully\ndeveloped in Leonardo Bruni's Laudatio urbis Florentinae, which was written in\nthe first years of the century, 59 and in the first book of his Historiae Florentini\npopuli, which was finished in I415,160 the year after the completion of the\nfrescoes in the antechapel.\nThere can be no doubt that the tituli of our frescoes, as well as the pro-\ngramme as a whole, derive their inspiration from contemporary humanism,\nand it is probable that there is either a direct or indirect connection with the\nFlorentine humanists. The admiration of the Roman republic as an example\nfor the contemporary city-republic, though not new, was given vigorous and\nmore articulate expression in the writings of Leonardo Bruni; and in his History\nofFlorence we also find the concept which underlies the programme of the ante-\nchapel-that the decline of Rome began with the fall of the republic.'6'\nWhile the historical approach to the uominifamosi cycle itself appears to reflect humanist enthusiasm for Roman history, the Aristotelian element in the pro-\ngramme would equally have met with the approval of humanists like Bruni.l62\nOn October 13, I413, Pietro de' Pecci and Ser Cristoforo di Andrea had\nbeen put in charge, as will be remembered, of the supervision of the new fres-\ncoes for the antechapel; on November i, Pecci was sent as ambassador to\nFlorence.163 One of the purposes of this embassy was to confer with John\nXXIII before his departure for Bologna,164 which took place a few days later.\nThe Pope had been staying outside Florence since June, when he fled from\nRome after its capture by King Ladislas of Naples; he had brought the Curia\nwith him,165 among them Leonardo Bruni, who had been apostolic secretary\nsince 1405-166 It would have been strange if Pecci had not taken advantage\nof the opportunity offered by his embassy to discuss the programme of the\nantechapel with some of the scholars who were then in Florence, and to secure\ntheir advice and help; and it is tempting to think that one of them may have\nbeen Leonardo Bruni himself.167 Such a course of action would have been\nnatural enough for a man like Pietro de' Pecci, who was a lawyer of some distinction, and later one of Aeneas Sylvius Piccolomini's teachers at the\nUniversity of Siena.l68\nBut apart from such humanist contacts, there were also other circum-\nstances which in 1413 could have helped to bring about a specifically Floren-\ntine inspiration of the new Sienese cycle of frescoes. Those years were one of\nthe rare periods when Florence and Siena stood united in defence of their\nindependence. At the turn of the century, Florence had fought Giangaleazzo\nVisconti single-handed, while Siena had accepted his rule; but now the two\nTuscan republics were united in their resistance to King Ladislas of Naples\nwho, after taking Rome, was pressing north, thus resuming his advance into\nTuscany of 1409, which had been halted by the Florentine-Sienese league.169\nFor the Florentines, in their struggle against Visconti expansion, the defence\nof their political independence had been tantamount with that of their re-\npublican regime;170 they had time and again sought to defend both by\nconcluding leagues with other Tuscan republics; and much the same implica-\ntions were again present in their resistance to Ladislas.171 In Siena, on the\nother hand, the republican regime had been restored after Giangaleazzo's\ndeath in 1402, and provided a further bond with Florence in their common\naction against Ladislas. Florentine republicanism in its new humanist\nformulation may therefore have proved particularly attractive to Florence's\nally in those years. It seems, in these circumstances, hardly a coincidence that\nthe programme of the antechapel centres on three citizens who upheld Rome's\nrepublican regime at home and three who defended her independence in the\nfield: a combination which would have come naturally enough to Florentine\npolitical humanism of the early Quattrocento.\nThe humanist inspiration of the programme and the inscriptions of the\nantechapel may also have left their mark on the execution of the frescoes. We\nhave seen that the combination of figure and titulus probably presented an\nattempt to imitate ancient statues and elogia ;172 the architectural setting of\nthe principal figures in an open portico may equally have been influenced by\ninformation regarding the statues in ancient Roman fora and temples, as, for\ninstance, in the Forum Augusti, although the execution of the arcade is tradi-\ntional enough.'73 The armour of the three Roman generals is evidently\nintended to reproduce ancient armour, as is shown, for instance, by the lion- heads on Scipio Africanus' greaves.174 Like Roman legionaries, they carry\nsword and pilum, and in the case of Curius Dentatus and Scipio Africanus, the\nclipeus;175 Furius Camillus wears on his head a fillet which bears some resem-\nblance to the corona civica as found on Roman monuments.176 But the artistic\nvocabulary of the figures is still basically Trecento, with the addition of\nelements derived from classical sources.177 Much the same is also true of the\ndress of the citizens, which represents a not very successful fusion of contem-\nporary civic dress and the Roman toga. The pagan gods follow mediaeval\niconographical tradition, but the execution is simpler and less overloaded with\nallegory.178 As we have seen, the acanthus frieze round the virtues, with its inserted\nmedallions, bears some resemblance to the jambs of the Porta della Mandorla\nin Florence.179 This frieze is continued on the main wall alongside the figures\nof the six Roman heroes, down to the bottom of the frescoes; in that on the\nright, next to the figure of Scipio Africanus, we find two putti, one of them\nfacing the Roman hero and blowing a horn. Both by their position within the\nacanthus and their execution they have much in common with those of the\nPorta della Mandorla.i80 Professor Krautheimer has recently emphasized the\nantique inspiration of these figures as well as of the acanthus scrolls of the\nPorta della Mandorla, although much of the execution is pseudo-classical ;181\nand the same seems to apply, in a more modest fashion, to Taddeo di Bartolo's\nputti (P1. 19c), which may be influenced by the Florentine model, and indeed\nto some of his figures of Romans and pagan gods. However, while the masters\nof the Porta della Mandorla used classical models, Taddeo di Bartolo seems\nto have tried primarily to bring up to date a traditional artistic vocabulary\nby infusing into it elements based on literary information rather than visual\nknowledge. That the result is somewhat bizarre is not surprising; but what\nmatters to us above all is the intention; and, indeed, perhaps the very inade-\nquacies of Taddeo di Bartolo's pseudo-classical figures reflect some of the\nproblems of a period when links began to be forged between humanism and\nart.182\nThe Sienese citizen who, coming from the Sala de' Nove, entered the ante-\nchapel from the Sala del Mappamondo, found himself in a memorial hall of\nRoman republican heroes with pagan divinities, which formed a curious con-\ntrast to the adjoining chapel. At the same time, he would find here the same political concepts which had been expressed in a rudimentary way in the\n'Maesta' and then, in a much more complex and philosophical fashion, in the\nallegories of the Sala de' Nove; justice and the common good as the basic\nprinciples of good government, and the all-importance of internal peace and\nunity for the preservation of the state. Thus in the new language of humanism,\nthe political philosophy of Trecento Siena finds a fresh formulation which may\nhave satisfied both traditionalists and modernists.\nFrom now onwards, the use of Roman republican heroes remained a\npermanent feature of Sienese civic art. In 1445 we find Cicero with Mucius\nScaevola and the first Brutus in a fresco (P1. 2oc) in the town hall of Lucignano,\na small but strategically important Sienese town on the border of Florence's\nterritory;183 in 1464, Antonio Federighi decorated one of the marble seats of\nthe Loggia di Mercanzia in Siena with reliefs of Roman citizens and soldiers,\nincluding the first Brutus, Cato Uticensis and, probably, Furius Camillus\n(P1. 20a).184 And when in 1529 the Sienese government commissioned yet\nanother cycle of frescoes for its palace, this time for the Sala del Concistoro,\nDomenico Beccafumi based his programme once more on a combination of\nvirtues and Roman citizens, with the addition of Greek heroes.185 The images\nand portraits of Taddeo di Bartolo are replaced by historical scenes, and the\nvirtues have been further reduced in number; but side by side with Justice\nand Concord we find Patrie Amor (P1. 2ob), which condenses in one single\nconcept most of the political ideals of the earlier frescoes.'se To teach civic\nvirtues by pictorial representation had remained a tradition dear to the\nSienese,'87 and the spell of the Roman republic had survived the despotism\nof Pandolfo Petrucci.8\""
