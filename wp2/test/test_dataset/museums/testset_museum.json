Dabei spielen Kategorien wie Zeit, Raum sowie geschichtlich und kulturelle Bezüge eine wichtige Rolle. Der Bildausschnitt, die Montage und die Wahl des Moments werden von der Künstlerin gezielt eingesetzt um das Skurrile und Absurde aufzuzeigen. In Ihren Arbeiten beschäftigt sich Jermolaewa unter anderen auch mit der russischen Kulturgeschichte die durch ihre Arbeitsweise Gegenstand einer subtilen Kritik wird. Five Year Plan ist ein andauerndes, nicht abgeschlossenes Projekt, für das Jermolaewa alle fünf Jahre die Passanten in der Moskauer U-Bahn filmt. Die Videos vergleichend betrachtend, ist festzustellen, dass kaum Änderungen in Kleidung und Werbung zu beobachten sind. Die einem Loop ähnlichen Aufnahmen zeigen weder den Anfang noch das Ende der Rolltreppe, die immer gleich bleibende Bewegung kommt einer Stagnation gleich. Der Fünf-Jahresplan war ein Vorhaben des Sowjetischen Regimes zur ökonomischen Förderung des Landes. Die Arbeit von Jermolaewa ist ein ironischer Kommentar, nimmt einen kritischen Standpunkt zur russischen Politik ein und zeigt den gefühlten Stillstand der Bevölkerung unter dem Regime auf.

In its 167 years history, Vlisco has created innumerable commemorative fabrics for events of local or global importance. Their archives include a design commemorating the end of World War II featuring Franklin D. Roosevelt and Winston Churchill, one printed in 1963 for the creation of the independent Republic of Nigeria, and another from 1991 celebrating Nelson Mandela’s release from prison. \nLast year Vlisco created a fabric commemorating an event closer to home—the succession of King Willem-Alexander to the Dutch throne on April 30, 2013. The design features a portrait of the king with his wife, Queen Máxima, in a central medallion. The background shows one of Vlisco’s best-selling fabrics, called Fish Scales, coming off the rollers, as in the factory. \nThe fabric was printed as a limited edition, and was not available for purchase.","language":"EN"},{"id":"https://www.rijksmuseum.nl/en/collection/RP-P-1991-685/catalogue-entry","doctype":"museum","museum":"rijksmuseum","title":"Set of Smoking Utensils","fullText":"A set of smoking utensils comprising a pipe wrapped in a piece of cloth and a tobacco pouch made of gold leather with a pattern of various fruits, the silver clasp shaped as two rats. The ojime holding the cords together appears to be a decorative glass bead; the netsuke is a simple wooden manju. The ensemble undoubtedly represents a luxurious smoking set, gold-leather usually being a European import, although there were many local attempts at imitation. Three poems by Nagai Akimasu, Ōya Atotsugi [later Kōshurin Atotsugi, the son of Ōya Urasumi],2 and Gofukube Itondo (or Itohito). Though probably trying to please Gofukube Itondo who, judging from his name, which translates as 'Clan of Honorary Material', seems to have been in the drapery business, the second and third poems are rather conventional, and although the first is hardly evocative, it reads: Pushing aside the silken flossy snow on the fields, I am going to pick young herbs on the still-damp Mount Nurioke, \n-nurioke puns on 'supports for drying cotton', norioke.

The handling of earlier works, using delicate chalk strokes, is replaced by broadly applied passages of wash, conveying a sense of serenity that is echoed by the classical Arcadian composition. The scene is structured by a steady rhythm of verticals, diagonals and curves from the two tall fir trees and the ruins of the tower, vaults and column. The staffage has also changed in character: the figures are less angular and have slenderer proportions, with simple, rounded contours. Though the drawing’s full date has unfortunately been trimmed at lower right, its last digit is most probably an ‘8’, based on comparison with a stylistically related drawing dated 1658 in the Statens Museum for Kunst, Copenhagen (inv. no. TU 82 e/8).12 Another similar drawing from 1658 appeared on the Paris art market in 1995.13 Van der Kabel’s stylistic evolution can also be appreciated in an undated painting by him that was auctioned in Paris the same year, 1995.14 This stylistic shift towards Arcadian classicism may well have been prompted through exposure to works by French artists such as Gaspard Dughet (1615-1675). Two quickly drawn views of Lyon on a double-sided sheet in the Frits Lugt Collection, Fondation Custodia, Paris (inv. no. 39, recto and verso),15 feature a similar classical approach, including elegant staffage. These views suggest that the present drawing might have been made in Lyon, still belonging to a pre-Italian phase of Van der Kabel’s oeuvre. A stay in Lyon circa 1658-60, en route to Italy, where he is documented between circa 1660 and 1665, has often been hypothesized but never proven.16 Annemarie Stefes, 2019","language":"DE"},{"id":"https://www.rijksmuseum.nl/en/collection/SK-A-4952/catalogue-entry","doctype":"museum","museum":"rijksmuseum","title":"Still Life with Silver-Gilt Glass Holder","fullText":"This intimate little banquet piece, which has never before been published, is executed in Abraham van Beyeren\\u2019s typical manner with rapid brushstrokes and thickly applied highlights. The composition is dominated by the winged wine glass on the right and the silver-gilt glass holder with the figure of Bacchus in the middle, which is very probably a variation of the salt cellar created in 1639 by the Amsterdam silversmith Johannes Lutma.8 The eight-pointed salver in the foreground is terribly misshapen, however, and the peaches lack definition and texture. The overall theme of the painting seems to be a celebration of times of plenty, as every object exudes luxury and wealth. If the closed pocket watch is supposed to be a reminder of the transitory nature of these material goods, it does so very unobtrusively. According to the dealer\\u2019s label on the reverse of the panel there should be remnants of Van Beyeren\\u2019s monogram, but recent examination failed to reveal any. His authorship is not doubted, however. Although the thickly applied paint and erratic highlights seem to point towards the later stages of the artist\\u2019s career, after 1660, his only dated works with the same eight-pointed salver are from 1654-55. In fact, all of Van Beyeren\\u2019s pictures dated in that period show this particular object.9 The pocket watch, on the other hand, does not correspond to those occurring in his still lifes from these years. The remarkable glass holder seems to be unique in Van Beyeren\\u2019s oeuvre, but it is found in paintings by his Amsterdam rivals Willem Kalf and Willem van Aelst from around 1655 and 1659 respectively.10 Erlend de Groot, 2021 See Key to abbreviations, Rijksmuseum painting catalogues and Acknowledgements","language":"EN"}]}
