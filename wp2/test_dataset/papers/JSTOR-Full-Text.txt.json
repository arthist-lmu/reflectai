May, The scene is, we suppose, intended to represent the interview between Lear and his daughter Cordelia. Although a very pretentious, this can not be said to be a good picture. It is tricky, and not always correct in drawing. The color is hardly worthy of Mr. May. There are, however, some good points in the grouping, and there is fair vitality in the action. No. 342. \"Portrait,\" by W. M. Hunt. A well arranged group, and very pleasent in color. No. 346. \"Loves Melancholy,\" by Mr. Con stant Mayer. Very fine in expression, but per haps a little. forped. In attempting to give a tearful dxpression to the eyes, the painter has made them too liquid, so that they seenm to be dissolving in tears, and actually running out of the young lady\\'s head. The effect is a little over done, and yet it may be allowed on the plea of a sudden suffusion springing up from a momentary bittertlought, The hands are beautiullly painted and very expressive, and Mr. Mayer cannot re ceive too much praise for his arrangement of thle drapery. The conception of this picture is exquisitely poetic, and the feeling is tendler anld beautiful. The girl is no idealized beauty, but a lovly speci men of simple wonianhood, in the freshness and delicate roundness of youth. The whole figure, in its graceful lassitude, faitlhfully anid charmingly expresses the sentiment of the picture. No. 334. \"November Mornling,\" by Mr. Gilbert Burling.

By far the best picture that Mr. Fred ericks has yet painted. This picture, differently hung, would appear to be, what it really is, a very good piece of color; but? unfortunately, the gray tone tnroughout the shadows is almost identical in color with the wall whiclh the Acad emy has so ingeniously paitted, to the utter ruin of many excellent pictures. No. 372. \"Shakspeare Arraigned before Sir Thoulas Lucy for Deer-Stealing,\" by Mr. J. W. Ehninger. There is in this pictufre some very good painting. Mr. Ehninger, perhaps, has not safficiently considered the perspective of the figures; those in the foreground are some what to large to be correct, and the group wants compactness. The costumes are generally well painted. No. 375. \"Drifting,\",by Yr. W. J.Hennessy. This a picture strikingly unpleasant in color, and sug,gests too strongly.other compositions of the same subject by eminent foreign. artists. The treatment of accessories is in some respects ex cellent, but the faces are too vague in drawing to be expressive. The eyes as in the gentlemen\\'s picture, \" In Memoriam,\" seem to be omitted.

It would, perhaps, be .better for Mr. Oertel\\'s reputation were, he to confine himself to crayon drawingcs, in which he is remarkably suc cessful; and still more should -he abstain from animal subjects,-in which his slight knowrledge of comparative anatonmy otten leads him astray. The color of this picture, both in light and shadow, is very injudicious; The chiara-oscuro is also incorrect, -There is no difference indicated, eitlher in outline or intensity, between the general shadow thrown across the group by some object out of the picture, and the cast shadows directly under the feet.of the animials. This is an inex cusable error. Among the errors in drawing, we notice all the legs of the animals, the .chest and shoulders of the led horse, the arms and shoulders of the negro on horseback, tbe neck and head of the horse upon which he is riding, and especially the two oxen chained together, who could not possibly take the relative ppsitions in wlhich they are drawn, on account or the well-known law of physics that two bodies cannot occupy the same space at the samue time, .

This is a vast extent of landscape, which, 1rom the total absence of feelingc and the lack ot any one point of Interest or visible eflect, amounts really to nothing, as a- work ot.art. It might be clharac terized as a portrait of the American flag and the flagstaff on which it is hung; and its value might be appreciated by the fact that the subject, being being upon a large scale, necessarily required a correspondingly large canvass. No. 415. \" At the Front,\" by Mr. George C. Lambdin. A pleasing, picture, were it not for the painful fact that the principal figure, like sonme others of which We have alreacdy spoken, is eye less. Wlhether this is occasioned by some wound which he has received, but of which there is no outward indication, or is owing to some absence ,of mind on the part of the painter, we do niot know. But the fact remains that the unfortunate hero is as utterly and hopelessly blind as the tishes in thie Mammoth Cave. At the next Acad emy Exhibition, we expect to see a numiber of fi, ures painted without noses, which would make an agreeable variety. Apart from this, there is really striking merit in the picture, both as to color and-character.']"

Gautier said: \"Art for Art\\'s sake means, for its adepts: the pursuit of pure beauty without any other preoccupation.\" That is-the slenderest kind of an idea, or no idea at all; no purpose, as Lessing suggests, of any kind; no sentiment or thought-simply beauty of compo sition and of craftsmanship. Well, in Watteau\\'s 198', 'Page 200 \"THE VOYAGE TO CYTHERA\" BY WNATTEAU Sepg 9', 'December 1916 THE ART WORLD 201 picture we have this mediocre aim realized most cleverly. Kythera is a large island off the cost of Laconia and in ancient times it was sacred to Venus, who had a famous temple there. The cyclopoedia says: \"To make the voyage to Cythera is a sort of euphem ism which signifies to give one\\'s self up to the pleas ures of love.\" Therefore this celebrated picture of Watteau apotheosizes purely and simply the philos ophy of Hedonism so popular at the end of the reign of Louis XIV. The Messrs. de Goncourt, says this writer, have appreciated with a very fine spirit, and in a highly refined language full of verve, the part that Watteau played in the French school of painting: \"The great poet of the eighteenth century is Wat teau. A creation, an entire creation of poetry and revery has issued from his head, brimming his work with the elegance of a superhuman life which the painter drew from the enchanted visions of his imagination. He has made gracefulness \\'to live again. \"With Watteau gracefulness is no longer that of the\\'ancients, a rigorous and solid charm, the per fection of marble-work in the Galatea, the very plas tic seductiveness and the material glory of the Venuses. Gracefulness in Watteau is just graceful ness. It consists of that next-to-nothing which drapes a woman with an attractiveness, a coquettishness and a good-looks quite beyond physical beauty. It consists of that subtle thing which seems to be the smile of the line, the soul of form, the spiritual physiognomy of manner. All the seductiveness of woman in repose: languidness, sloth, abandonment of decorum, touches of back to back, extension of limbs, looks of carelessness, a rhythm in poses, the pretty touch of bent-over profiles, the backward movement of bosoms, the supple lines of the feminine body and the play of taper fingers on the handles of fans-and the indiscretion caused by tall heels that peep below the petticoat, and the lucky chances of personal bearing, and the coquetry of gestures, and the play of shoulders and all that knowledge which the mirrors of the last century taught woman-the mimicry of attitude and grace-all these lived again in Watteau with his flower and his Walloon accent! \"And what a stage setting! \"A land that was an accomplice, woods full of gallantry, meadows resounding with music, bosquets fitted for the fun of echoes, trees like cradles from which hang baskets of flowers, delightful deserts far away from jealous persons, refreshed by fountains and peopled with marble statues! Water jets sud denly spring up in the centre of courtyards of farms. Suns befitting apotheoses, lovely sunshine sleeping on greensward, verdurous depths visible and trans lucent, delicious country charm, murmuring deco rations beautifully trimmed, gardens embowered in thickets, rosehedges, French landscapes set with the pine trees of Italy! Villages gay with weddings and coaches and ceremonies, and festivals gone daft with violins and flutes! Rustic scenes with the green curtain and stage backed with blossoms, upon which the Comedie Frangaise ascends, upon which gambols the Comedie Italienne. .. \"How happily does this Italian fashion, sparkling and bizarre, unite itself to the infantile French fashion of the eighteenth century! And what an adorable mode is born from these two wedded and interfused fashions-the Watteau mode! A fashion of venturesomeness and freedom, wandering and benign, one that snatches to it the new, the zestful, the provocative; the tailor\\'s shears of an artist that in pure playfulness discovers careless neglect and fine dressing, the neglige of the morning hours and stately dress of the afternoon-shears of the fairies, snipping lively and short, stinting neither the costly stuffs nor the eyes of the gallants; delightful shorten ing of skirts, ravishing rockery of folds, narrow corsage, baskets of silk from which the flowering flesh emerges! 0, ye beribboned shears of Watteau, what a lovely kingdom of coquetry did you not cut and carve in that straightlaced realm of ntins belong ing to the Maintenon! \"This literary fantasticality gives perfectly an idea of the agreeable imaginings of the painter of Fletes Galantes; it would be difficult to express in a style more stimulating, charminig and seductive, ideas and subjects more contrary to the reality. And with respect to the execution of the pictures Watteau is not a whit less spiritual, original and fantastic.\" Here we have a picture devoted to celebrating the joy of living which we call only clever, while the \"Triumph of Silenus\" on page 199, also devoted to the celebration of the joy of living, we call great. Why is Watteau\\'s picture less great than Rubens\\'? First: because the subject chosen by Rubens is of more universal significance-more understand able by mankind at large. Second: because the subject is more clearly and profoundly expressed. This is done through a greater concentration of the attention of the beholder on the expression of the figures, accomplished by a greater unity. There is no mass of vague trees, hills, etc., painted in a scene-painter\\'s way, as there is in the picture by Watteau, who began as an apprentice to a \"decora tor.\" This divides the attention of the spectator too much between the personages and the landscape, thus weakening the expression and power of impression of his picture. Moreover Watteau broke up his figures into about eight different groups, each doing different things. Hence he violates the first law of all truly great art -concentration of effects. In fact his whole picture is scattering in its appeal. While in Rubens\\' picture the appeal is concentrated on Silenus, who easily dominates the picture, and therefore grips us power fully and instantly emotions us with the definite emotion of humor as we see this lusty expression of hilarity; it becomes an abiding joy as we contem plate it. In other words Rubens\\' picture is a power ful, masculine expression of intense life, while Wat teau\\'s is a weaker and more feminine expression of superficial life. Third: Rubens\\' drawing is not only impeccable but powerful, while Watteau\\'s drawing is far less so, giving his effort a far less serious, hence a more dilettante, character. Now impeccable drawing is the most difficult thing in any art and requires the most serious effort. The total comes to this: while Rubens\\' work seems the effort of a Titan, Watteau\\'s seems the effort of a be-ribboned, be-laced and be-perfumed-dilettante -but a dilettante so very, very skilful and gracious in his artificiality, so graceful in soul, so thoroughly radiating the prevailing spirit of his time that it is', '202 THE ART WORLD December 1916 a masterpiece of refined, albeit somewhat theatrical cleverness. The great need of the American world of art is artists who can draw in a vigorous, correct and living manner. To do that requires a power of in tellectual energy possessed only by a man of strong nervous system, one strong enough to engender a will-power sufficiently gripping to hold the mind and attention true to the closest observation of nature, the most faithfully lifelike rendering of the thing seen. All the better if he slightly stylizes what he sees, as Rubens did. It must always be remembered by some of our readers that, everything being equal in two works of art, that is the greater of the two which expresses most profoundly and completely the central idea or emotion it is supposed to express: First, in the totality of the work and second, in the one or two faces of the main figures about which the whole drama of the work revolves. In fact, in the final analysis, not composition or drawing or technique or color should be the highest aim in a work of art, but completeness and satisfying adequacy of ex pression, to which end all the other art powers must act as means and instrument. The face of Christ in Leonardo\\'s \"Last Supper,\" the face of the Sistine\" Madonna by Raphael, the faces of the Marquis of Spinola and Justin of Nassau in \"The Lances\" by Velasquez are the keynotes of those three masterpieces. The adequacy or inade quacy of the rendering of what ought to be expressed on those faces determines the place occupied by each of those pictures in the scale of excellence in the hierarchy of art. In the case of the picture by Velasquez-which he nearly ruined through vio lating the law of the concentration of effects-he saved it only by the masterly sufficiency with which he expressed on the face of Spinola the sympathetic gallantry in which he is accepting the keys of Breda from the defeated Justin of Nassau. In fact, these two figures represent the highest flight of Velasquez as an expressive artist. In this picture by Rubens, on page 199, the ex pression of the thing to be rendered, namely, the joy of living, is conveyed through the totality of the picture and then in a supreme way through the face and torso of Silenus, while in Watteau\\'s picture the same joy of living is expressed only in the totality of the picture and not with any intensity through the individual figures or groups. In fact, it is evident that Watteau, being fundamentally a decorative and not an expressive artist, sacrificed profundity of expression of emotion to surface and decorative beauty, in which he succeeded. But while the deco rative beauty of his picture is no greater than that of Rubens, only different in kind, it falls short in convincing adequacy of expression. Hence, while pleasing to the mind it fails powerfully to rouse our emotion. Rubens\\' picture not only charms our mind by its supreme intellectual qualities but it stirs our emotion and laughter profoundly-at least when we see it for the first time. That is why it is a great work of art, while Watteau\\'s work, falling short of supreme greatness, is only clever. But it is so dextrous in touch, so exquisite in melody of line, so deliciously bravura in its de tail, so suggestive of a Frenchified paradise of Haroun al Raschid, that it is at once a perfect example of motiveless art for art\\'s sake and of spirituelle cleverness; therefore is it fit to serve as a drop-curtain in the greatest opera house in the world to which mankind might come for one of the most necessary medicines-relaxation! Not seriously great, yet greatly clever, it will never inspire to lofty effort-but it will always help to dispel our gloom.']"

      "fullText" : "['A Statue of Aphrodite in the Royal Ontario Museum By CORNELIA G. HARCUM IN 1909 the Royal Ontario Museum of Archaeology acquired a Parian marble statue, which came originally from the mainland of Greece, and with its basis is just six feet high. It was presented to the museum by Sigmund Samuel, Esq. The woman, or goddess (P1. IX), stands majestically with weight resting on her right foot, her right hip projecting, her left knee bent and slightly advanced. She looks in the direction of the free foot. The position gives the impression of perfect repose yet of the possibility of perfect freedom and ease of motion. On her left arm she originally carried a babe, whose tiny fingers still rest gently on her breast. The woman does not look at the child, however, but with a mild, gentle, almost dreamy expression gazes into the distance with the air of one serenely proud of her motherhood. The figure is clad in a thin chiton which quite reaches to, in fact, almost trails on, the ground. This is girt high just under the breast, and has slipped down over the right shoulder, revealing the beautiful neck and shoulder; but with a happy restraint the sculptor has arrested it by the right breast, which it covers. Over the chiton is draped a himation, which falls over the left shoulder, covers almost the entire back of the figure, and is brought round under the right arm. The upper part, in a roll, crosses the front of the body and is tucked under the left arm; the lower part hugs closely the hip and leg to below the knee; the end is caught up by the left arm and falls in graceful folds at the side. This enveloping drapery suggests that of the Muses on the Mantinaean relief and is so handled as to reveal rather than conceal the beauty and freedom of the figure, which has the full proportions of the matron rather than of', 'PLATE IX TORONTO, ROYAL ONTARIO MUSEUM OF ARCHEOLOGY: VENUS THE MOTHER', '46 THE COLLEGE ART ASSOCIATION OF AMERICA. the maid. The lower part of the figure is typically Phidian in that one leg is modelled through the drapery while many folds completely envelop and conceal the other. The drapery on the back of the figure (P1. X, Fig. 1) is less care- fully finished, or, rather, is finished in less detail than in front and on the sides, thus seeming to suggest that the statue may have stood in a shrine so arranged that it was seldom seen from the back. On the right side from the waist to the knee the folds of the chiton may be plainly seen through the himation (P1. X, Fig. 2). The marble has a beautiful creamy yellow tone, but its surface has suffered both from the weather and from the pick of the excavator. It seems probable that the head was broken off and buried long before the rest of the statue fell. Thus protected for many years by its covering of earth, while the body was still exposed to the weather, it retains on the brow and cheeks a polish and finish not found on the rest of the statue. It too suffered some injury, probably from being knocked around while lying beside the statue before it was buried. The hair in front is somewhat worn away. Both ends of the knot on top, and the knot at the back of the head were broken off and have been restored. The same is true of parts of the nose, lips, and chin. The only other restoration on the statue is the plaster which joins the head to the body. Unfortunately, the whole of the right arm and the lower part of the left arm were broken off and are missing. The left side shows that this figure, like so many of ancient times, was not made of a single piece of marble, but was skilfully pieced (P1. X, Fig. 3). The holes and iron fastenings which may still be seen on the left arm indicate where the attachment was made. On the right side, what appears to be a dowel-hole may indicate another attachment. The statue presents a picturesque style of coiffure (P1. XI, Fig. 1). The hair is parted in the middle, and waving tresses from either side are drawn up and tied in a fancy knot at the top of the head. Round the head is a bandeau, which may be seen at the side (P1. XI, Fig. 2). This style of arranging the hair seems not to have been entirely un- known at the middle of the fourth century, and to have', \"m FIG. 1 FIG. 2 TORONTO, ROYAL ONTARIO MUSEUM OF ARCH.EOLOGY: VENUS THE MOTHER FIG. 3 I'\", 'THE ART BULLETIN. 47 obtained quite a vogue during the next hundred years. There are examples which indicate that it may have been used even earlier than 350 B. C. The Apollo Barberini in the Glyptothek at Munich shows a somewhat similar arrangement. Several heads with the hair arranged in this style apparently take their inspiration from Praxiteles or his successors. A head of Aphrodite in Boston (P1. XII), which shows by the oval of the face and the expression of the features that it is the work of an Attic master, probably of the school of Praxiteles, is an example. A marble head of Aphrodite now in the British Museum\\' not only offers an interesting example of this mode of coiffure but also shows a close resemblance in expression to the Toronto statue. The same style of headdress is found on the Capitoline Aphrodite, a variant of the Aphrodite of Cnidus2. Two statues of Aphrodite in the Cook collection3, Aphrodite tying her sandal and Aphrodite Mazarin, are further in- stances of the style, as is also the Crouching Aphrodite in the Vatican\\'. Examples among the later statues of Venus might be multiplied. A head of Hygeia or Artemis in the Barracco Collection, Rome\", which is a Greco-Roman copy of an Attic statue of about the middle of the fourth century, may be noted, as well as a head of Artemis or Core, the original of which belongs to the school of Praxiteles or his 6 sons. This headdress also calls to mind immediately that of the Apollo Belvedere, which may be, as Dickins\\' says, a new version of a work by Leochares. The Oldfield Apollo in the Ashmolean Museum, the Pourtales Apollo, and the Barracco Apollo are further examples which show a some- \\'Reinach, Recueil de ttes antiques iddales ou iddalisdes, pl. 189. Reinach says that this type of Aphrodite was certainly influenced by Praxiteles but does not belong to his school. The author of the original should be sought, he thinks, in the group of artists to which Leochares belongs. 2Von Mach thinks that in deference to the taste of a later age the simple hairdress of the Cnidian was replaced by a more picturesque design. 3Mrs. S. A. Strong, Journal of Hellenic Studies, XXVIII, 1908, pp. 11 and 15; pls. VII, VIII, and X. 4Von Mach, Handbook of Greek and Roman Sculpture, p. 324; University Prints, Series A, pl. 294. 5Reinach, op. cit., p. 149; pl. 188. 6Ibid., pl. 190. 7Hellenistic Sculpture, p. 70.', '48 THE COLLEGE ART ASSOCIATION OF AMERICA. what similar type of hairdress\\'. Professor Gardner2 thinks that this style may have originated with Leochares. It is occasionally found on heads of Artemis, Nike, Eros, Thanatos, Hygeia, and others, but it seems to have been adopted most frequently for heads of Aphrodite and Apollo\\', perhaps because it required a very high type of beauty to make it a success. One would imagine it rather trying for less beauti- ful beings. It is, then, a style which was rarely used as early as the middle of the fourth century, and which became very popular during the Hellenistic Age and later. It was especially popular for the goddess of beauty, and is most frequently found on nude or partly draped figures of that goddess. With this description of the appearance of the figure and the style of the headdress, let us pass on to other problems. One naturally wishes to know first of all whom the statue represents. In the Royal Ontario Museum it bears the title, \"Venus the Mother,\" and that title appears with the first published illustration of the statue, in Art and Archce- ology, II, pp. 61 f., where also a brief description is given. One realizes that whenever a statue is discovered which seems to merit the inscription, \"To the fairest,\" mortals still render the decision to Aphrodite. In justice to other goddesses, however, and women as well, this decision should be questioned, especially as there is no attribute here to help solve the problem. The suggestion has been made that the statue is not that of a goddess at all, but that it is a tomb figure which was erected by a husband for his wife and child who died at the same time. This does not, however, seem probable. It is no doubt true, as has been pointed out by Percy Gardner\\' and others, that many Greek statues, both male and female, from the archaic Apollo statues down, are in reality tomb figures. The Apollo of Thera was found in the neighborhood of the rocky cemetery of that island. The Hermes of Andros was discovered in a sepulchral chamber 1Cf. also Reinach, op. cit., pls. 242 and 243 for a head of Apollo in the British Museum. 2Journal of Hellenic Studies, XXIII, p. 117. 3Cf. Reinach, op. cit., for numerous other examples. *Sculptured Tombs of Hellas, p. 135.', 'I- m FIG. 2 FIG. 1 TORONTO, ROYAL ONTARIO MUSUEM OF ARCHMEOLOGY: HEAD OF VENUS THE MOTHER It tVl M cr4 1-0', \"THE ART BULLETIN. 49 and seems to indicate that the man who died appears in the tomb in the guise of Hermes. Of female figures, the feet of a statue on the Acropolis were found attached to an in- scribed basis which shows that the statue was set up as an image of the deceased. There are also female seated figures of an early age which appear to have adorned tombs: a charming example is the so-called Penelope, in the Vatican, seated in pensive mood, the original of which dates from the fifth century B. C.' The Museum of Berlin has acquired two interesting statues of women seated in attitudes of grief, which almost certainly belong to tombs; they date, probably, from the fourth century B. C. The Mourning Woman of Trentham2 in the British Museum is another example of a tomb figure. The style and subject suggest that it was originally set up in the Athenian Ceramicus, for which even Praxiteles is said to have made statues. Examples might be multiplied to show that many statues not always so considered are in reality tomb figures. There seems to be, however, as Gardner has said, a curious similarity of type about all the draped female tomb figures. This similarity is not shared by our figure. Usually the mantle envelops even the arms and hands in its folds, and frequently it covers the head also. Frequently, too, the head is slightly bowed, and there is almost invariably a suggestion of gentle melancholy. This is true, on the whole, of fourth and fifth century reliefs of family groups, as well as of single figures. Even when the women on these reliefs are represented as attending to the affairs of daily life and not as bidding their families adieu, here breathes from the monuments, in most cases at least, a sentiment of sadness. Neither the enveloping drapery nor the suggestion of melancholy are apparent in the statue of the Royal Ontario Museum, which seems only serenely happy. It may be noted, too, that on tomb reliefs where mother and infant appear, the child is usually in the arms of an attendant3. Ten reliefs of mother, and child in 'Cf.

Furthermore, Professor Currelly assures me that there is nothing in the provenance of the Toronto figure to suggest that it comes from a tomb. There does not, then, seem to be much evidence for regarding this statue as a tomb monu- ment. Its size, while not impossible for a woman, is of heroic proportions, more appropriate for a goddess. The majesty of pose certainly seems indicative of a goddess. The winsome sweetness of expression, the suggestion of a smile, the ease and grace of motion seem to point to the goddess who was the ideal of all womanly beauty and charm. The coiffure, too, as we have seen, is one which was frequently adopted for the goddess of beauty. We often associate the nude with Aphrodite, but we must be careful to remember that this association is derived from late representations of the goddess. In archaic art, with the exception of the Cypriote statuettes, she usually appears fully clad. In the fifth century, as far as we know, there was no Greek statue of a nude goddess'. The gold and ivory statue of Aphrodite in Elis by Phidias, the Aphrodite Ourania in Athens8, also by Phidias, the Aphrodite in the Gardens by Alcamenes were all, no doubt, fully draped. On vases Aphrodite is usually clad, and also on early mirrors and terracottas. Down to the middle of the fourth century the fully clothed figure predominates. When Praxiteles presented to the people of Cos the choice between a draped and an undraped Aphrodite, the story goes that they unhesitatingly accepted the former. The far greater fame and popularity of his undraped Aphrodite, which then went to the people of Cnidus, may have started the rage for the nude, which grew steadily stronger for the next hundred years and later. That the undraped goddess was an innovation in the time of Praxiteles is shown by the fact 1Conze, Die attischen Grabreliefs, pls. 274-9, 281, 3, 6. Cf. also Journal of Hellenic Studies, XVI, 1896, pl. VII; here a standing nurse hands an infant to a seated mother. 2Miiller, Nacktheit und Entbliissung, p. 145, speaks of an archaic Greek marble cult statue of a nude Aphrodite found at Orvieto, and there are several Peloponnesian nude representations in bronze.

SPausanias I, 14, 7.\", 'PLATE XII BOSTON, MUSEUM OF FINE ARTs: HEAD OF APHRODITE', 'THE ART BULLETIN. 51 that an explanation of nudity was supplied by the indica- tion that the goddess was preparing for the bath. Even the later Venus of Arles is partly nude because she is at her toilet. In early times disrobing required a motive to account for it. In modern times we are prone to think of Aphrodite as merely the bewitching goddess of lighter love, who beguiles both mortals and immortals by her charms. There is, however, considerable evidence both in literature and in art that in antiquity she was regarded as mother also. Certainly in literature this function is repeatedly ascribed to her. A Homeric Hymn\\' tells vividly the story of her infatuation, Zeus imposed, for Anchises. She herself prophesies to this beloved mortal, \"To thee, Anchises, shall a dear son be born.\" That the goddess had no in- tention, however of taking her duties as mother too seriously is quite evident, for she continues, \"So soon as he sees the light of the sun, the deep-bosomed mountain nymphs shall rear him for me.\" Nor was she anxious to reveal this love affair with a mortal; she charges Anchises, \"But if any mortal asketh thee what mother bare this thy dear son, say that he is thy son by one of the flower-faced nymphs.\" Hesiod2 says also, \"Cytherea with the beautiful crown was joined in sweet love with the hero Anchises and bare Aeneas on the peaks of Ida with its many wooded plains.\" And Homer3 emphasizes the relationship. He speaks of Aeneas, whom holy Aphrodite bore. Aeneas himself says\\', \" The sire I boast is Anchises, great of heart, and my mother is Aphrodite.\" Indeed, in the Trojan War, so strong is the love of the golden mother that she forgets that not for her are the works of war, and she enters battle and is wounded to save her son Aeneas, whom she proclaims the dearest to her of all men. Nor was Aeneas her only child. Hesiod\" tells us that Cytherea bore to Ares, the shieldpiercer, Panic and Fear, \\'No. V. 2Theogony, 1008.

Moreover, she was the mother of Harmonia. The union of Aphrodite and Eros, says Bernoulli', is post-Homeric and is found first in the poetry of Hesiod. The ancestry of Eros is decidedly uncertain. In Hesiod he is, with Earth and Chaos, one of the primeval beings2, but also he is the companion of Aphrodite3. According to a later and com- moner tradition of his birth, he was the youngest of the gods whose mother was Aphrodite, and his father was Ares, or, less commonly, Hermes. His brother Anteros also was supposedly descended from Aphrodite and Ares. Hence, according to literary tradition, Aphrodite was the mother of at least six children: Aeneas, Harmonia, 0o016, AEL.IR , Eros, and Anteros. The literary tradition of Venus as mother appears to be, in early times at least, stronger than the artistic. In art Eros seems to be the only one of her children who is rep- resented with her; and even he is, no doubt, frequently considered merely her companion or attribute, so to speak, not necessarily her child. Probably the earliest union of the two is found on mirrors. In an example in the British Museum, of the last half of the sixth century, the figure of Aphrodite forms the stand, while from the mirror hang two winged boys, Erotes'. Another early representation of Aphrodite and Eros is found on a terracotta relief, probably dating about 450 to 440 B. C5. Aphrodite holds a pome- granate blossom in her right hand, and on her outstretched left arm stands Eros. A Greek terracotta of the transition period found in a tomb at Corinth, and now in the museum at Athens6, shows Aphrodite standing with Eros at her side. On the east frieze of the Parthenon Aphrodite is seated and a winged boy, Eros, leans agains her knee as she points out to him the Panathenaic procession.

It is barely possible that the draped Aphrodite of Cos may have been represented as mother, but it is not probable. At any rate, the statue in the Louvre, which Furtwaingler2 considers a copy of the Aphrodite of Cos, has a little Eros standing beside it. Furtwingler says, how- ever, that this figure of Eros could not have belonged to the original but is the work of the copyist. Engraved gems of the best period of Greek art also show the two characters together. On a translucent carnelian scaraboid from Kertch in the Hermitage Museum, a seated woman, probably Aphrodite, clad in a long tunic and mantle, leans forward to kiss a nude winged Eros, and on a carnelian ring stone in the British Museum Aphrodite, fully draped, save for her right breast, which is bare, is seated with a nude winged Eros leaning against her3. It is interesting to note that in all of these early examples, wherever found, Eros is not an infant, but a lad or small boy. It has been aptly said that he grows steadily younger from the youth of Praxiteles (though even before that he is rep- resented as a boy) to the boy of Lysippus. It is not until the Hellenistic Age that he reaches infancy and that we find the chubby Cupid so beloved in Hellenistic and Roman art and so frequently found with the nude Aphrodite'. It is also significant that in none of these representations of Aphrodite and Eros, and in very few of the many of later times is the goddess holding the child in her arms. He usually stands at her side, or is perched on a dolphin or on her shoulder. These facts suggest that the statue which we are con- sidering, although it may possibly represent Aphrodite as holding in her arms one of her own children, really bears a stronger resemblance to a development of the mythological 'Op. cit., p. 13. 2Masterpieces, p. 323. 3Cf.

This type appears in Greek art at a very early time, but probably by the third century it loses most of its mythological signifi- cance and becomes, in the Tanagra statuettes, a purely genre type of mother and child. Both seated and standing figures are found at all periods, and almost always the goddess tenderly holds one or more children in her arms\\'. Naturally, the first goddess to appear in this capacity, and the one most frequently so represented, is Gaea, the earth goddess, who typifies the kindly, fostering care of the soil, and is the all-mother, who nourishes all living things on earth, in sea, and in air. She is called KovpoTrpO~o in Hesiod2, where Rhea gives her, as probably the first of her charges, Zeus, the youngest of her ch ldren, to save him from the fate of his brothers: \"Him did the vast Earth receive from Crete to nourish and bring up, and she came carrying him swiftly through the black night to Lyctus.\" In a Homeric Hymn3 Gaea is called the mother of all. Frequently, she is represented as fostering two children, as on the Carthaginian relief4, where she is seated on a rock; fruit lies in her lap, and a lamb and calf are at her feet. On a black-figured vase reproduced by Gerhard\\' there is a goddess who carries two children in her arms; she is un- doubtedly Gaea, according to Roscher. And again, on a black-figured amphora in the Louvre6 she has two children. The same type with two children is found also in an archaic terracotta statuette from Rhodes\\'; and many primitive Cypriote terracottas represent Gaea KovporTpO\\'6o, or Earth as nursing mother\\'. Several other goddesses, notably Demeter, shared with Gaea this function of KOvpoTrp oS, nurse or fosterer of \\'Cf. British Museum Catalogue of Terracottas, pl.

A terracotta statuette of Demeter in the British Museum' stands with right leg bent, holding against her breast a child in her left arm. The goddess Tyche also appears as the KovpOTpco09 of a special place. She is found in this capacity on coins of Melos of imperial date. Here she is bearded and holds a child on her left arm. The charming statue by Cephisodotus, of Eirene , the god- dess of Peace, nursing the child Plutus, Wealth, is, of course, the best known example of the type of the KovpOTpO'O9 or fostering goddess. This statue illustrates a new ten- dency appearing in the art of the beginning of the fourth century, or of the end of the fifth. Its touch of nature and human affection remind one of the Madonna and Child of medieval art, and it is undoubtedly a prototype of the motif of mother and child which has been so popular throughout the ages. Eirene bears the epithet KovpOTpopO9 in Euripides8, and Hesiod' says that Peace, the nurse of children, is abroad in the land. This early fourth, or late fifth, century group of Peace with her child Wealth may possibly have suggested Praxi- teles' treatment of his Hermes, which is a still further ex- tension of the same idea, though this time a god, not goddess, is the fosterer of youth. The elder brother at the command of his father Zeus is taking the baby Dionysus to the nymphs of Nysa to be reared. However, as Gardner has well pointed out3, Hermes is not a mere abstraction, a representation of the idea of protector and fosterer of youth. He is, indeed, a real personality, a god made human, but he is nevertheless a development of the earlier mythological conception. Still another famous group of a somewhat similar type is that of Silenus holding the nfant Dionysus. Klein6 calls this a third generation and says that it was called to life by 1Ibid., C. 495, p. 238. 2There are copies of this in New York and Munich. 3Bacchae, 420. 4Works and Days, 228. Cf. also representations of this goddess on coins of Athens and Cyzicus. 5Six Greek Sculptors, p. 145. 6Praxiteles, 396.\", '56 THE COLLEGE ART ASSOCIATION OF AMERICA. the Hermes, and that as in the Eirene and Plutus we see the past of the Hermes, in this group we see the future. The group is more dramatic, and the child, which is simply a foil to Hermes, is here definitely half of the composition. It is, then, extremely common in Greek literature and art to find a god or goddess as nurse, nurturer, protector of youth, and many are so represented: Gaea, Tyche, Demeter, Eirene, Hermes, Athena, and others. In some of the representations, however, as in those of Eirene and Hermes the mythological significance may be secondary to the political meaning of the statue. To such a series I think our statue of Aphrodite may belong, though it is difficult to say how much of the mythological concept it retains. We do know, however, that the function of Aphrodite KOVpo~rp oo is extremely old. This is shown by the story in the Odyssey\\' of the children of Pandareus, who knelt alone, orphans in the palace, nourished there by blessed Venus with curds and honey and sweet wine. Even though there is no monument which we may certainly call Aph- rodite KOVporpo\\'Os, there are, as we have seen, many representations of goddess and child. In the absence of an attribute or symbol which reveals Aphrodite, it has been the custom to consider these as representations of Demeter or Gaea. However, some of them may represent Aphro- dite2 , and it is particularly probable that some of the primitive terracottas of woman and child portray this goddess . Another reason for thinking that the statue in the Royal Ontario Museum is Aphrodite KOVpoT7p6o0 is the grow- ing tendency to associate or identify Aphrodite with Gaea, the earth goddess. Professor Fox4 says of our example that Aphrodite here seems to represent the special develop- ment of the earth goddess, who typified the kindly fostering care of the soil. He has since published an article entitled \"Aphrodite, Mother Earth,\"\" in which he brings together 1XX, 67. 2Bernoulli, op. cit., pp. 121-123. 3Cf. British Museum Catalogue of Terracottas, A. 10-14. 4Mythology of All Nations, Greek and Roman, pl. I. 5American Journal of Philology, XLI, no. 3, p. 283 ff.', \"THE ART BULLETIN. 57 the literature suggesting that Aphrodite was originally an earth goddess. Farnell' reaches the conclusion that the terrestrial aspects of the goddess are the primitive ones. Professor Fox, after a detailed study of the Aphrodite myth and cult, reaches the same conclusion, and goes further. From a recent discovery by French excavators of the sacred inner omphalos of Delphi and from a passage in Hesychius, 7y\\x7f \\x7fak o aX 'rd a ol Kal AEX\\x7fol2 the Delphic omphalos seems to be earth's own image. If Hesychius' statement is true, says Professor Fox, it follows that also the Paphian omphalos is earth's image; but since the omphalos of Paphos was regarded as an image of Aphrodite, one is forced to regard Aphrodite herself as the earth goddess. If she is identical with Gaea, the earth goddess, she no doubt shared with her the function of Kovpor7poos and is so repre- sented in art. To sum up, then, this statue in the Royal Ontario Museum may represent Aphrodite KovpoTrpOdo4 because of the position of the child, which was held in her arms, not perched on her shoulder or standing by her side, as Eros usually is; because Aphrodite is certainly one of the &0aZ KOvporpo4Ot; because she is closely associated with, or is, the earth goddess, whose chief function was nurturer of youth; and because the statue bears a certain resemblance to such others as those of Eirene. An important question is the date of the statue. The figure has the full, solid proportions of the early draped goddess. It shows a restraint and lack of the voluptuous softness which is especially characteristic of later statues of Aphrodite. This is particularly true of the breasts. ReinachW, who believes that the form of the breasts and their distance from each other furnish reliable evidence for dating female sculpture, thinks that on this statue they indicate an early date. The serenity and lack of senti- mentality in the face suggest at least a fourth century origin. 'Cults of the Greek States, II, pp. 642-653, 750-755. 2Eumenides, 1-8. 3Revue des Otudes grecques, XXI, 1908, pp. 13 ff.\", '58 THE COLLEGE ART ASSOCIATION OF AMERICA. The rhythmic pose indicates Praxitelean influence. The high girt drapery, too, may be, as the figure of Artemis from Citium, now in Dresden\\', and the Muses on the Mantinaean relief show, as early as Praxiteles; but it is probably not earlier. The style of headdress came in, as we have seen, about 350 B. C., though it was more fre- quently used later. The pose, then, the high drapery, and the headdress date the work probably as late as the second half of the fourth century; and if the figure is that of Aphrodite bearing in her arms the infant Eros, it cannot be earlier than Hellenistic times, since Eros does not reach infancy before this time. Another indication of Hellenistic date is found in the drapery. On the right side of the statue, as we have observed, the folds of the chiton show clearly through the mantle. Dickins2 calls attention par- ticularly to this Hellenistic drapery, which is transparent not, as earlier drapery, for the purpose of displaying the body beneath it, but for displaying other drapery.3 On the whole, therefore, it seems probable that the statue is of Hellenistic date, of about the end of the fourth century4, and that it shows certain eclectic features common to Hellenistic sculpture: the Phidian leg, the Praxitelean pose, the rather small head of Lysippus. It is true, as Dickins\" says, that Attic artists of the late fourth and the third century made use of all their predecessors and pro- duced statues in which we find the disiecta membra of half a dozen styles. At the same time, we may recognize in the Toronto example the predominance of Praxitelean tradition. \\'Cf. FurtwAngler, op. cit., fig. 141. 20Op. cit., p. 45. 3This style of drapery and especially the position of the feet remind me of Roman female statues of vestals and others, types which go back, however. to Lysippus and Greek originals (Cf. Art and Archeology, VIII, 1919, p. 345; Ny Carlsberg Glyptotheks Antike Kunstvaerker, Tillaeg, pl. X, 552a, etc.). D. M. R. 4I am inclined to date the statue in Hellenistic times, but later than 190 B. C. Transparent drapery hardly existed before the time of the great altar at Pergamum, and transparent drapery of the Rhodian type not before 190 B. C., as Dickins (op. cit., p. 46) says. D. M.
