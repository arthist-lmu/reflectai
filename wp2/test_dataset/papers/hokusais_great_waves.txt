Katsushika Hokusai's Under the Wave of Kanagawa (Kanagawa
oki namiura), popularly known ni the Anglophone world as The Great Wave, occupies an iconic place in modern visual culture (Fig. 1). Widely cited in word and image, included in exhibitions around the world, the focus of a documentary film ni aseries about artistic masterpieces, and, most recently, featured ni the British Museum/BBC radio program The History of the World in One Hundred Objects, it is, in the eyes of many Euro-Americans, Japan's most representative artwork. This is not true in the country of its origin, however, owing to the fact that it is not a unique work of art but a woodcut of which thousands of impressions were made for popular con- sumption. Okakura Kakuzo, writing in 1900, called into ques-
tion the print's authenticity as a representation of Japan when he declared that "the history of Japanese art cannot be written through ukiyo-e."' In his view, the Euro-American privileging of "pictures of the floating world" failed to take into account their true cultural place in the country that produced them. And yet, the modern-day celebrity of The Great Wave cannot be explained without recourse to its recep- tion in nineteenth-century Japan. Looking at the sociocul- tural context in which Under the Wave of Kanagawa was pro- duced and consumed helps to explain how and why it came to be singled out from the series Thirty-six Views of Mount Fuji of which it is a part.
Scholars in Japan, Europe, and the United States have examined this image's artistic and design elements chiefly in relation to Mount Fuji, with interpretations predicated on Hokusai's personal devotion to the immortal mountain, the new spirit of empirical inquiry expressed in his views of it, or
its privileged status as an emblem of Japanese national iden- tity? These approaches, though appropriate given that the mountain defines the series, overlook the multiple levels on prmut eett which this particular view may be read, as well as the many readings of the wave itself, which may be related to a range of
images, practices, institutions, and texts.
Under the Wave of Kanagawa was but one of many renditions
of a motif that cumulatively registered a new interest in
maritime imagery in Japan from the 1790s through the
1860s. Waves already had a long and multivalent history in
Japanese literary and visual arts before the nineteenth cen-
tury, but during this period, external and internal events
combined to make them critical sites through which many
artists, but most notably the prolific and long-lived Hokusai,
provoked thought about their country's shifting geopolitical
circumstances and, especially, its vulnerability to foreign in- cursions."
Over a career spanning six decades, from the 1790s until his death ni 1849, Hokusai produced image after image of waves. No other artist before him treated this subject so
obsessively or creatively. There are scenic views of waves breaking on the beach at Enoshima; book illustrations of
waves identified with legendary feats of heroism and self- sacrifice; designs of waves for the decoration of personal accessories and architectural interiors; artists' instructional
manuals with incoming and outgoing waves; depictions of waves in the formal, semiformal, and cursive brush styles; a boat fighting waves to enter the famous Cave of the Three Deities; rabbits running over waves; ghosts haunting the waves where ships had foundered; a great wave seemingly morphing into plovers; male and female waves; One Thousand Images of the Sea, a series (never completed) whose title, Chie no umi, may be understood acoustically to mean "sea of wisdom"; and even a Taoist magician conjuring waves from the palm of his hand. While many of these enjoyed wide circulation, Hokusai's many variations of a single great crest- ing or tumescent wave especially captured the public imagi- nation by bringing into an integrated and magnified aes- thetic focus disparate external disruptions whose full import was not yet fully perceived or understood. As Susan Stewart has written in another context, "the gigantic presents us with
an analogic mode of thought... [involving] the selection of
elements that will be transformed and displayed in an exag- gerated relation to the social construction of reality."' Widely disseminated in his own prints and illustrated books as well as in reinterpretations by other artists, Hokusai's "great waves" commented on a new maritime reality by their singularity, heroic scale, pictorial style, and even their very materiality.
Fears of Foreign Invasion
The idea that the waves encircling the Japanese islands shel- tered them from outside intruders was deeply rooted in Japanese thinking. In a poem in the eighth-century anthology Man'yoshu, Japan si described as a beauteous island "hidden by athousand lapping waves."* But waves did not simply hide and protect; a passage in the Nihonshoki, a mythologizing account of Japan's history also written at that time, testifies that they were thought to have divine agency as well. The wave was the means through which the legendary Empress Jingü exercised and extended her power over territory on the present-day Korean peninsula: "The Wind-God made a breeze to spring up and the Sea-God uplifted the billows," so that "without the labour of the oar or helm, they arrived at Silla." When the "tide-wave following the ships reached far up into the interior of the country," the king of Silla grew fearful of its destructive force and submitted to the divine power of the invading country? These intertwined notions of Japan as a country protected and guided by divine winds and waves were recurring themes later associated with the abortive Mon- gol invasions of 1275 and 1281 and, fueled by late eighteenth- century nativist scholarship, with the prospect of European incursions.® Evidence of this linkage are the nearly fifty cop- ies of a fourteenth-century illustrated handscroll recounting
the drama of the Mongol invasions that were created from the late eighteenth cent

Japan was not a seafaring nation during the Tokugawa period (1603-1868). The shogunate had banned the con- struction of all ships over five hundred koku (forty-nine gross tons) "such that they can withstand high waves and weather a counyrtototrelen,ognifodeaht,theowhlethte waters of the archipelago had sails, oars, and an open stern to prevent them from taking to the open seas. In the 1780s these limitations even led some feudal lords secretly to seek infor-
mation on how to build better oceangoing ships commensu-
rate with those that, under the auspices of the Dutch East
India Company, entered the southern port of Nagasaki every summer."'
Although only Nagasaki was open to European vessels, this port and others were active conduits for trade with China and Korea throughout the Tokugawa period.!? In the last quarter of the eighteenth century, however, Russian, American, and British ships were also demanding access to ports around the archipelago. Foreign vessels were already regular sights in the vicinity of the southern ports of Nagasaki, but increasingly they were pressing for entry into the northern harbor of Hakodate. As a verse written about 1800 by Tokugawa Haru- mori, the feudal lord of Mito, put it: "Hakodate Bar- rier / Guardsmen, / Be alert! / This si not a time when only waves come to shore."19
Sightings of foreign naval ships of the Izu and Böso Pen- insulas, leading to the bay that gave access to the shogunal capital of Edo, also caused alarm. Hayashi Shihei was one of a number of government officials who, at great personal cost, sought to alert the shogunate that encroaching foreign forces demanded a new outlook on Japan's watery periphery. The need to protect the country from foreign vessels perceived to be as powerfully built as "small fortresses" led him to write "Military Talks for a Maritime Nation" ("Kaikoku heidan," 1791), which opens with the question "What is meant by a maritime nation?" and goes on to address the defense prep ar
ations

"bordered on
al sides by the sea."la While he held that defensive measures alone were
sufficient, others spoke to the need to develop international commercial shipping and trade. Sato Nobuhiro, in his "Ab- breviated History of the Western Powers" ("Seiyo rekkoku shi ryaku," 1808), declared, "There is nothing that compares with shipping and commerce to strengthen greatly a nation's i n t e r e s t s . " 15
The rumored threat of a Russian invasion, followed in 1804 by the so-called Rezanov affair, in which a Russian diplomat landed in Nagasaki in the hopes of opening trade negotia- tions but was turned away, further fueled anxieties. Such chreats led in 1825 to a shogunal edict ordering foreign vessels entering Japanese ports to be fired on, as was the AmericanMorison,whenitenteredUragaBayni 1837,using the return of seven shipwrecked sailors as a pretext for initi- ating trade, as Rezanov had earlier done. Adding to these events, accounts of China's defeat at the hands of the British ni the Opium War of 1839-42, popularized ni the semific- tional "New Tales of aForeign Land" ("Kaigai shinwa," 1849), prompted warnings that China's failure resulted from "a deficient sense of national unity and patriotism."16 Expres- sions of growing concern intensified following Commodore Mathew Perry's arrival in 1853 and, especially, the signing of the Treaty Port agreements in 1854 and 1858. Foisted on Japan by the Western powers, these gave extraterritorial rights, first to lands around the ports of Shimoda and Hako- date, and later around Yokohama, Kobe, Nagasaki, and Ni- gata. These humiliating infringements of Japanese sover- eignty were not abrogated until 1899.
Hokusai's Great Waves
Hokusai created a great wave that expresses the outside world both con eptually and artistically. His sweeping view of hte Seven League Beach, Shichirigahama, at Enoshima, with the shrine of Benten and Mount Fuji in the distance, where the singular cresting wave makes its first appearance, speaks to a key locale in which this motif's new twofold pictorial identity was constituted (Fig. 2)." As the presence of surfers today demonstrates, Enoshima was one of the few places with real waves along the Edo/Tokyo coast. Consequently, waves breaking on the shores of this scenic spot were a feature of many woodblock prints. Hokusai's illustration in Threads of the Wilow (Yanagi no ito), a 1797 album of comic verse (kyoka), however, was unusual in its mobilization of Western perspec- live in combination with a single outsize wave in the fore- ground. Arrested in motion at the moment of cresting, the wave is made to look three-dimensional in a way that makes it as conspicuous a presence in the landscape as Mount Fuji. Despite his study of the principles of linear perspective to situate objects in space, Hokusai deliberately exaggerated the relationships of scale so that the wave competes for attention with the distant cone of the sacred volcano.
Waves breaking on a shore were not a new pictorial theme, but Hokusai's vision both contributed to and reflected heightened awareness of the actualities of Japan's coastal topography. Imaginary views of rocky coastlines with crashing waves had figured in screen paintings known by the generic
title "rough seas screens" (ariso byöbu) beginning ni the six- teenth century.!& Many of these highly stylized works were suffused with poetic resonance by their identification with Matsushima, a scenic locale in the north made famous by the haiku poet Bashö.'® In the late eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, however, these gave way increasingly to more em- pirically oriented marine views, including carefully observed topographic records of the coast for military purposes, such as those painted in 1792 by Tani Bunchö at the request of the shogun's chief councillor Matsudaira Sadanobu.20
Yet even imaginary renderings were not entirely free of intimations of the natural violence of waves. In a screen

heightened awareness of the way the sea may become a destructive force even in one's familiar surroundings. There si no evidence that Körin's playfuly disruptive imagé was intended as a tidal wave, but the artist would have been aware
of the catastrophic tsunami that so frequently followed earth- quakes and volcanic eruptions, such as that of Mount Fuji in 1707.22
While Hokusai may have been motivated by a variety of
considerations in depicting the cresting wave at Enoshima, his chief objective is likely to have been a desire to exploit the rising tide of enthusiasm for Western idioms introduced by, among others, Shiba Kokan, an outspoken proponent of the "Dutch" style, whose view of the Seven League Beach with Mount Fuji in the distance Hokusai may have seen on display at the Atagoyama Shrine. Kökan had presented his two-fold screen, painted in materials that simulate the effect of oils, to the shrine's votive hall the year before Hokusai published his print in Threads of the Willow, and it remained on public view there until 1811.23 Whatever his intentions, Hokusai's reiter-
ation of the subject in Yanagi no ito and other similar prints helped to popularize views of this famous seaside spot with a great wave.?1
Enoshima, within a day's journey from Edo, was a popular site for outings, often under the guise of pilgrimage to the shrine of Benten, the goddess of wealth, love, and seafarers. It was a public stage where contact between strangers could take place, and men and women of different classes exposed themselves to the gaze of others. The seashore had long been associated with transient sexual encounters. Visits to the shrine of Benten evoked such brief engagements since it was only at low tide that pedestrians could reach the island cave where the goddess's shrine was located, and they had ot leave before the tide turned. This tenuous relation with the main-land also made it a particularly suitable site to try out new representational codes. By the same token, we can begin to see here how, even as the great wave was framed in local terms, the idioms used in its representation defamiliarized a familiar space.
The success of this and other treatments of the singular- ized wave led Hokusai to use it again and again in various combinations. Its frequent redeployment also reflected prac- tical considerations: the artist was under constant pressure to supply his publisher with new designs, and one successful print generated demand for another. Such commercial im- peratives help to explain his multiple renditions of ships in stormy seas, a theme first assayed in View of Hommoku of Kanagawa (Kanagawa oki Hommoku no zu) and Rowing Boats in Waves at Oshiokuri (Oshiokuri hato tsüsen no zu) (Fig. 4), two very similar horizontal-format prints issued about 1800-1810 for a series of eight pictures of Edo and its environs.25 The former features a large vessel equipped with mast and sail, and the latter, the more vulnerable small skiffs (oshiokuribune) that carried fresh fish between the Boso Peninsula and the shogunal capital of Edo-the same type that would recur in Under the Wave of Kanagawa. In these views of boats pitchil and tossing in the trough between two giant waves, fact al fantasy combine to give metaphoric expression to the co and benefits of the flow of people and goods from across t seas. Although the boats themselves are Japanese, the prin horizontal format, brown and green color scheme, and d orative frame are all conventions associated with Dutch cr perplate engravings. These artistic references to Europe : reinforced by the added strangeness of the horizontal insci tion.
Although its indebtedness to a European model is nor explicit, an illustration in Strange Tales of Northern Eci (Hokuetsu kidan, 1813) represents another variation on ' theme (Fig. 5).26 Hokusai's terrifying vision sets a ghost s atop a towering, unstable mountain of frothy water with ominous black sky animated with eerie-looking storm clo behind it. The Japan Sea off Echigo (modern-day Nig Prefecture) is notorious for its turbulence, and tales of si ings of phantom ships circulated widely in its coastal com nities. In this version, a certain Captain Magosuke has s an encounter but overcomes its threat by his fervent prato the compassionate deity Kannon, who, according to the
Lotus sutra, promises devotees protection from perilous seas." This vision of the dangers of travel to China by Japa- nese pilgrim monks is distinguished from earlier pictorial narratives by the replacement of serial waves with one gigan- tic one that completely dominates the scene.
The phantom ship, which recurs in a number of Hokusai's prints, speaks pointedly to the fantasies and nightmares that the giant wave aroused in Edo-period Japan. The romantici- zation of the sea and seafaring so pervasive in European literary and visual arts had little place in Japanese tradition. Those seeking to test their mettle or to escape from the social and political strictures of their world did not set out to sea but
look to the mountains, a traditional Sino-Japanese site of spiritual rebirth. As the historian Marcia Yonemoto has ob- served, "The construction of ocean fears and fantasies al- lowed the Japanese to engage the idea of an overseas 'else- where' while maintaining only limited contact with (and evading threats from) non-Japanese peoples and cultures. *28 Although sailing out of sight of land was rare in the Edo period, harrowing accounts of boats swept off course by a typhoon or the currents were all too common, making ships in stormy seas an inauspicious pictorial subject.?9
None of the boats in these three designs is Dutch, but the representation of a boat in storm-tossed seas was likely in- spired by Hokusai's study of an imported print or a Japanese copy of one.30 In the seventeenth century, when the Dutch republic had become a powerful trading nation with posts as far away as Batavia and Nagasaki, its artists were recognized throughout Europe as masters of marine painting. The rep- ertory of Hendrick Vroom, Willem van de Velde the Elder, his son Willem van de Velde the Younger, and Ludolf Back- huysen, among others, included river and coastal views with ships, fleets of commercial ships, and naval battles as well as boats in stormy seas, a genre for which Vroom and Back-huysen were especially noted." Some of their paintings were translated into engravings that might have reached Japan a century later. 23
Under the Wave off Kanagawa
In 1831, a quarter of a century after his Rowing Boats in Waves at Oshiokuri and View of Hommoku off Kanagawa, Hokusai reinterpreted these narratives about boats struggling against a cowering wave by the addition of Mount Fuji. While the earlier images are also identified with Kanagawa, they do not feature the sacred peak, which became the unifying thread in his Thirty-six Views of Mount Fuji. Unlike the earlier versions, for this ambitious series, the artist used the larger ban (ap- proximately 93⁄4 by 41 inches, or 25 yb 36 centimeters) for- mat, which allowed for greater visual scope than the medium- size chüban format (approximately 81⁄2 by 111⁄2 inches, or 22 by 29 centimeters). He also situated the outsize wave within a
series of landscapes and cityscapes of unprecedented num- ber, all informed by their use of Western illusionism. The visual and material multivalence of Under the Wave off Kana-
gawa (fg. 1) made it one of the most successful views within the series.
No longer envisioned as a great mound of water with a toupeelike fringe, the great wave commands the picture plane, dramatically overshadowing the distant peak of Mount Fuji. Reconciling the essential contradictions between the movement of the water and the stillness of the mountain, this print captures and fixes the wave so that it paradoxically becomes a static, elegant, and poised structure rather than something fluid and ephemeral. While the wave's sheer scale and clawlike extensions are threatening, the potential for violence is undermined by the aesthetic artifice of making the smaller wave in front of it a visual double for Mount Fuji.

These visual strategies, draw- ing attention to the perceptual act itself by making us look over, through, and beyond things, subsequently became so hackneyed through the work of Utagawa Hiroshige and other printmakers that it is easy to forget how striking they must
have appeared when Hokusai first deployed them.
While he may have shared Shiba Kökan's conviction of the
value of Western pictorial techniques, Hokusai used them more playfully, for their spectacular effects. In so doing his work points to the role of cultural practices such as theater and public performances in shaping nineteenth-century view- ing habits. Hokusai was a master showman who, long before he produced this series, had captured the attention of a novelty-loving public by staging sensational displays of artistic virtuosity. To promote the publication of a new volume of his Random Sketches (Manga), in 1817, for instance, he painted before a huge crowd in Nagoya a 250-square-foot image of the Buddhist deity Daruma, an artistic feat commemorated in a souvenir print that carefully provides the impressive dimen- sions of the face, eyes, ears, and nose. 24 This same defiance of the norms of scale also underlies Hokusai's Fuji series, where the artist seduces the viewer by theatricalizing the wave. Just as Hokusai in his performance in Nagoya extended the fic- tional space of artistic creation to include the viewer, so, too, the vantage point adopted in Under the Wave of Kanagawa erases the boundaries between subject and object, transform- ing the viewer into a participant in this watery drama. In effect, the wave sets in motion a creative process that the beholder completes.
Hokusai's visual rhetoric underlines the fact that in Under the Wave off Kanagawa the wave's authority depends not sim- ply on its scale but also on its singularity. In his design, Hokusai has tailored the visual tools that woodblock print artists customarily deployed to celebrate glamorous courte- sans and Kabuki actors to devise a superstar wave. While modern viewers may liken the wave to the freeze-frame image captured by the camera, in the context of the nineteenth century, it would be more appropriate to see it as nature imitating art. The great wave performs much as does an actor when he strikes a dramatic pose, or mie, at the high point of a Kabuki play. Recognition of this commonality is evident in a clever print issued in Osaka, where the frozen form of Hokusai's great wave serves as a dramatic double for the stop-action pose, mie, of a Kabuki actor onstage in a new play (Fig. 7).91
Like the Kabuki theater with its stage extending into the audience, Hokusai's woodcut depends on a mode of theatri- cality that intrudes into the beholder's physical space. Hold- ing a print engages the hands as well as the eyes; the multi- sensorial impact of its feel, its weight, and the intensity of its color all contribute to the embodied experience of its dra-
matic visual design.
The use of Berlin blue, one of the distinguishing features
of Hokusai's Thirty-six Views of Mount Fuji, was an important constituent of this experience. When the publication of Thir- ty-six Views of Mount Fujiwas announced in the back of a book of stories by Hokusai's friend Rytei Tanehiko, the prints were advertised as aizurie.* This label identified them as being printed not with indigo but with a newly imported synthetic dye known in Japan as bero, the Japanese transliter- ation of Berlin blue, that produced a more intense, saturated hue resembling the cobalt of Chinese blue-and-white porce- Jains. Henry Smith's study of the "blue revolution" in prints has shown that Berlin blue was imported, possibly from China, sporadically beginning in the 1780s and 1790s, but it was only in the Bunsei era (1818-30) that large quantities made available by Dutch and Chinese traders brought prices down sufficiently for its widespread use in prints.45
When the advertisement for the series appeared at the end of 1830, according to Smith, five monochrome blue prints, including views of Mount Fuji from Shichirigahama and Tsu- kudajima, an island at the mouth of the Sumida River at the mouth of Edo Bay, had already been issued. The symbolic and expressive qualities of this first "pure" aizuri group were intimately bound up with the watery locales and activities depicted." The next group of five, stil predominantly blue, appeared at the New Year of 1831, with publication of the remaining works, only partially printed in blue, including Under the Wave off Kanagawa, Fine Wind, Clear Morning (pop- ularly known as Red Fuji), and Storm beneath the Summit, con- tinuing until 1833.
One measure of the series' sensational success is the fact that after the completion of the first thirty-six views, an addi- tional ten were published. Whether owing to cost or some other factor, these were printed with black rather than the blue outlines that had distinguished the earlier prints. De- spite the more limited use of bero, they generated enough public enthusiasm for the publisher to begin producing a second edition of the first thirty-six prints with black outlines and a variety of new color schemes. In addition, even as these single-sheet prints were coming out, Hokusai began his three- volume One Hundred Views of Mount Fuji, in which he reiter- ted the view of Mount Fuji with a wave in the fores but with its movement from right to left, in keeping ' direction a Japanese reader would view a book ( Whereas the first and the second volumes, the later ing the view of Fuji with a wave, were first published i the third volume did not appear until the 1840s.

Hokusai's Heroic Waves
Alongside the cresting wave figuring in his Thirty-six or One Hundred Views of Mount Fuji, Hokusai also made prints and book illustrations in which a great wave is paired with a heroic warrior. Wide circulation of images featuring this potent combination inflected the wave motif with a potent political
symbolism.
Hokusai first put great waves to imaginative use in epic
tales about Chinese and Japanese warriors in the illustrations to Takizawa Bakin's epic Strange Tales of the Crescent Moon (Chinsetsu yumiharizuki), a gargantuan project that brought both novelist and illustrator huge popular acclaim. Serialized from 1807 until 1811, Bakin's version of the adventures of the twelfth-century bowman Minamoto no Tametomo, the uncle of Yoritomo, founder of the Kamakura shogunate, was ac- companied by many illustrations featuring dramatic views of
however, has the visual power of the scene of Tametomo's loyal retainer Takama Isohagi committing suicide. Standing on a rocky promontory with his dead wife, Isohagi plunges a sword into his belly, the erotic violence of his gesture redou- bled by the tumescent wave that is about to break over him (Fig. 9). This drama of destruction and renewal is reiterated in the spindrift, which seems to spray like blood from his arched body. Suicide was the warrior's ultimate sacrifice, and as the site of purification rituals (harae), the seaside was an appropriate place to carry out such an act, since waves im- mediately washed away all traces of pollution.
As Mary Douglas has argued, the human body si a symbol for the social body, and when social groups are threatened, they use the body in a symbolic manner to define boundar- ies.52 The imaginative power of this juxtaposition of man and wave draws on the physical force of the wave as a metaphoric double for the warrior. With this symbiosis, Hokusai intro- duced a new, highly eroticized, and enduring image of mas- culinity that was used in many contexts and against many enemies."$ Fiction and its illustration, of course, are powerful tools for giving shape to new ideas, and in his retelling of these epic battles between rival clans competing for power, Bakin capitalized on the way myth gives collective expression to actual social experience and material conditions. In the historical recounting, Tametomo, a warrior on the losing side of the Högen rebellion, was sent into exile on the island of Oshima, where he committed suicide. In Bakin's version, however, the seven-foot-tall hero does not die in exile but escapes by sea, only to fall victim to a storm that causes his ship to go off course, landing in the Ryukyu Islands, where, after overcoming a demon, he marries a local princess. Oshi- ma, an island off the coast of the Izu Peninsula, however, is the setting of Tametomo's most celebrated exploit, in which, wielding a twelve-foot bow, he pierces the hull of an enemy ship and sinks it.
In the context of early nineteenth-century Japan, the nar- rative of Strange Tales of the Crescent Moon, in which the hero Tametomo journeys beyond Honshu to take control of is- lands, real and imaginary, transposes the classic themes of heroism and self-sacrifice into an expanded geographic framework. This new narrative is no longer centered on Kyoto (although the imperial presence is important) but directed toward the subjugation of islands once defined by their difference or exclusion from the mental universe of civilized Japanese. Until this time, the Ryukyu Islands were not spaces over which Japan felt a need to assert overt power, since they were taken for granted as tributaries. With the periphery realigned in the struggle to define and maintain Japanese territorial integrity, however, the seashore and naval bartles assumed new prominence as proving grounds for warrior valor and honor. Tametomo's subjugation of Oshi- ma, the Island of the Women, the Island of Demons, and, especially, the Ryukyus symbolically marked the expansionist scope of Japan's energizing national vision when control over the archipelago itself was increasingly in question.
Bakin's adaptation of the historic twelfth-century narrative was likely informed by the Chinese vernacular novel Water Margin (Chinese: Shuihu zhuan; Japanese: Suikoden) about a legendary band of 108 outlaws from China's periphery who carry out vigilante justice in the face of an unjust and corrupt government. The earliest known compilation of the Shuihu zhuan dates from 1589, and by the seventeenth century there were many printed and illustrated versions, but accounts of these heroes were in circulation in China long before that time. *5 Loosely based on historical events related to atwelfth- century Chinese rebel and his followers who took refuge from society in the marshy lands of present-day Shandong Province, Water Margin spoke to marginality on multiple lev- els: as a work of vernacular rather than elite fiction imported from China; in its celebration of outlaw heroes; and in its setting on China's southern periphery.
The subject of Water Margin-virtuous men, motivated by honor, justice, and loyalty who take the law into their own h a n d s - -was also read as a critique of the shogunal govern- ment in nineteenth-century Japan. Such readings were espe- cially common during the Tenpo era (1830-44), which saw earthquakes and poor harvests followed by widespread fam- ine and peasant uprisings that compounded the sense of impending disaster aroused by fears of foreign invasion. These catastrophes, widely interpreted as supernatural signs of bad governance, prompted the feudal authorities to un- dertake reforms that included restrictions on the consump- tion of frivolous luxury goods, including extravagantly poly- chrome prints promoting the Kabuki theater and geisha.5 Censorship is thought to have led publishers to focus more acceptable subjects, such as brave and loyal warric but the extraordinary recursive power of the unorthod heroes of Water Margin subverted the intent of the shogur dictates. 05
First introduced to Japan in the early eighteenth centu Water Margin was enthusiastically received, a response that ! ot numerous translations, reinterpretations, and print seri TakizawaBakin'shugelysuccessfulNwe IlustratedEditionof Suikoden (Shinpen suikoden), which was serialized for me than a quarter century, from 1805 to 1838, had much to with thetale's hold on ht
e public imagination." Baki version was accompanied by imaginative illustrations Hokusai, many of them depicting the outlaw heroes as ri viduals fighting evildoers on, in, and even underwater, dramatically new modes of portraying warriors that b shaped and reflected the sea as a site where military stren was tested. So popular were these images that in 1829 Hc sai issued a one-volume picture book with portraits of all heroes.58 Röri Hakucho Chöjun was celebrated for his ex‹ tional aquatic skills; in Hokusai's novel interpretation, prowess is expressed by his walking through the troi formed by two giant waves that he has seemingly t a m e d
his sword (Fig. 10).
The anthropologist Anne Allison's observations at modern superheroes also aptly characterize Tametomo, 1 Hakucho Chöjun, and other warriors fighting on the per ery immortalized by Hokusai:
Superheroes transcend the limits of human normalcy at the same time they work to restore what w a s normal (and disturbed by alien enemies, natural cal ties at home). The superhero myth, then, si about bors about extending them in one place only to reassert t somewhere else. As a fantasy as much about normali about exceptionalism, it is not only mythically unive but also concretely shaped by the times and place which it circulates as popular culture.59
The politicization and militarization of littoral space • mon to Bakin's novel and Water Margin are also pronou: in a scene in Hokusai's Heroes of Japan and China Illusi (Ehon Wakan no homare), one of a number of publica from his late years that celebrate warrior exploits in h original and imaginative ways. Hokusai is thought to completed the illustrations in 1833i, but the book's pul tion was interrupted by the restr ctions of the Tenp reforms, so it was issued posthumously in 1850.6° The sea long figured as a realm where mortals might discove divine, but such encounters generally required travelir ther far out or deep beneath the ocean. In the ep illustrated here, the dragon king of the sea emerges fr great wave breaking on the very shore where the warrior no Yoshisada stands (Fig. 11). This divine intervent: which recalls the divine wind, kamikaze, that destroye Mongol fleet in the fourteenth century-follows Yoshi: offering of his sword with prayers for the seas to recede army caen capture K'amakura and restore Emperor Go:  this motif with a larger set of moral values and meanings linked to Japan's mythic origins in the "age of the gods." The shore, to be sure, had long figured as a liminal space, but the appearance of the sea god here rather than deep in his palace beneath the waters suggests a blurring of the
boundaries of land and sea, making what was previously invisible or unknown part of the here and now. Two worlds merge around the wave again in an illustration for an adap- tation of a Chinese novel, The Wars of Han and Chu Illustrated (Ehon Kanso gundan, 1843), where a fierce and resolute Chi- nese warrior facing a dragon is doubly empowered by his equine mount and the leaping wave behind ti (Fig. 12).61 Here, too, the artist is not simply representing the wave but mobilizing it as a visual trope for its performative qualities. While the wave may function elsewhere as a signifier of the marauding foe that propels the hero, here it embodies the hero's divinely assisted response to it. Legends linking Kan- non's manifestation in the form of a white steed to save a
drowning woman may have contributed to this configura- tion. 25
The One and the Many
The iconic nature of the outsize wave was dependent on the cumulative impact of its multiple iterations by Hokusai and other print artists during and after his lifetime. Its various meanings made ti amenable to replication and reconfigura- tion in many forms and contexts, each with highly contingent
interpretations that, even sa they reinforced the cultural value of Hokusai's versions, inscribed new significations ot them. Prints were an important medium of communication ni nineteenth-century Japan, but they were also artistic com- mercial products intended to provide amusement and diver- sion; to read them primarily as ideologically driven risks giving them an intentionality that was not necessarily there
on the part of the artist. Yet the dynamics of the nineteenth- century political environment were such that much could not be openly articulated. References to current events were forbidden. This made artists adept at visual subterfuge and readers prone to look for hidden sociopolitical meanings, even when there were none." Despite their use of altered names and transposition of recent events to the distant past, artists could be punished by fines or imprisonment for real or perceived breaches of censorship laws. Not al the iterations singled out here refer specifically to the identification of the great wave with the foreign threat, but those published from the 1850s onward are more explicit, possibly because the weakened shogunate no longer had the authority to enforce these laws.
Variations of Hokusai's great waves were issued both as parts of new series focused on Mount Fuji and in indepen- dent form. The sampling introduced here gives some indica- tion of their range and expanded network of meanings. Hiroshige's 1852 reinterpretations in The Embankment at
Koganei in Musashi Province and his 1858 The Sea at Satto ni Suruga Province, each published within series titled Thirty-six Views of Mount Fuji, speak to the ongoing enthusiasm for serial views of the mountain, while also testifying to the redistribution of Hokusai's cultural capital by close quotation (Fig. 13). Hokusai's mountainlike wave also generated a witty reinterpretation by his pupil Yashima Gakutei, who resituated the theme in Osaka, a major center of trade whose economic clout challenged the political power of Edo. This print, in- spired by View of Hommoku off Kanagawa, depicts a ship in stormy seas between the trough formed by two huge waves with Mount Tenpo in the background (Fig. 14). In an age that delighted in theatrical gigantism, viewers would have been amused by this clever analogy between Mount Fuji and the artificial mountain constructed in 1834 of the soil
drained from the mouth of hte bay that became an Osaka landmark.
An anonymous broadsheet, kawaraban, showing a colossal
wave at the foot of Mount Fuji with humans, animals, and
goods caught up in its watery maelstrom testifies to the rapidity with which the album version of the great wave became independently recognizable and consumable (Fig. 15). Anonymous, free-floating, and potentially subversive, inexpensive kawaraban were an especially important medium of mass communication about topical issues. The lengthy caption on this one announces in part, "on the night of the seventh day of the fourth month of 1834, following volcanic tremors and a rainstorm, snowslides from melting snow poured down from the Fifth stage of the great mountain with resultant loss of life...." As Richard Lane has written in his study of Hokusai, this print "cleverly twisted the intent of Hokusai's design to imply floods from the mountain, rather than waves from the sea."* Although this broadsheet is os- tensibly informational, the wave of mud was represented as 
an unnatural phenomenon, whose destructive consequences could be understood as a divine sign of bad governance. Great waves are a recurring theme in the prints of Hoku- sai's contemporary Utagawa Kuniyoshi, who knowingly en- gaged in politically fraught subject matter, for which he barely escaped imprisonment. An artist who specialized in warrior themes, Kuniyoshi adapted one of Hokusai's illustra tions for his portrayal of Tametomo performing one of his Ten Heroic Deeds amid the curbulence of giant waves (Fig 16).6 Aprint in a series from 1835-36 that recounts the life of the thirteenth-century monk Nichiren, the founder of :religious sect whose many adherents included both Hokusai and Kuniyoshi, represents an especially creative reinterpreta- tion of both Under the Wave of Kanagawa and Hokusai's juxtaposition of heroes and waves (Fig. 17). The mountain in the distance evoking the shape of Mount Fuji represents Sado Island, where Nichiren has been exiled. En route there, Nichiren stands precariously but fearlessly on a small boat facing a great wave as he invokes the name of the Lotus sutra. As he does so, the very words he utters, namu myho rengekyo (honor to the wonderful Lotus sutra), appear on thecalm surface of the water beneath the threatening wave."? For Nichiren's followers, this image demonstrated the saint's su- perhuman power to calm the stormy seas through faith in the Lotus sutra, a scripture central to the sect he founded. This scene, however, would have taken on broader connotations ni light of the fact that Nichiren's prayers were widely held to have brought about the divine wind that caused the destruc- tion of the invading Mongol fleets. Viewers of the time are likely to have made the implied connection between the historical and present-day threats of invasion.
An evocative nocturnal scene of the monk Benkei standing at the prow of a ship in a print from 1886 by Kuniyoshi's follower Tsukioka Yoshitoshi suggests the enduring symbolic power of this dual vision of the wave as both a cause of fear and an opportunity to demonstrate the bravery required to transcend its threat (Fig. 18).68 Yoshitoshi's design recalls a mythic moment in the twelfth-century battle of Dannoura between the rival forces of the Taira and Minamoto, in which Minamoto no Yoshitsune's faithful retainer Benkei saves their ship by his prayers to Kannon when great waves are sum- moned up from the depths of the sea by the vengeful spirit of Taira no Tomomori. Earlier, Kuniyoshi had brought out many interpretations of this epic battle, often in the form of panoramic triptychs. In one published about 1851, the wave si a huge mound that towers above the ship, and the scene simade more menacing still by the silhouetted forms of ghosts of the drowned Tomomori and his cohort in background (Fig. 19).69 Images of these clashes were e cially frequent in prints from the 1850s and 1860s, just be the arrival of Commodore Perry and following the openin the treaty ports, a period marked by a profound sens social disorientation. Pictorializations of these familiar traumatic historic events provided a coherent framework reassuringly reminded viewers that, just as such disrupl had been resolved in the past, so, too, they would agair At a time of dramatic changes marked by intensified ceptions of vulnerability with respect to the European ers, the wave became a rhetorical device in depictions o Mongol invasion as well. In a print from 1863 by Kawa Kyosai, a giant mound of a wave fills the center panel of a triptych where ships have been destroyed, but Mongol ships have been replaced by foreign vessels, and the figures being thrown about by the blast are dressed in European uniform
(Fig. 20). This print is thought to have been issued after the forces of Chöshu fief, on the southern island of Kyushu, opened fire on British ships, and the British retaliatedby bombarding Satsuma, the capital of nearby Satsuma fief." Hokusai's originality lay in singling out the wave, custom- arily represented as part of a sequence, arresting its move- ment, and magnifying it in a theatrical manner that gave it a recognizable identity. Stewart, writing of the gigantic, ob served that "aesthetic size cannot be divorced from social function and social values."? The individualized great waves
that became ubiquitous in the visual culture of nineteenth- century Japan underscore her recognition that scale is part of a complex system of signification that is temporally and spa- Lialy contingent. While not all of the great waves figuring in the prints and book illustrations of Hokusai and other artists make explicit the danger of foreign invasion, with their dra-
matic scale and frequent combination with warriors and ele- ments of Western perspective, they formed part of a new and culturally specific maritime lexicon that was widely recog- nized and understood to signal geopolitical changes. Hokusai's great waves gained exposure and became worthy of critical attention through their replication. Commercial opportunism led other print artists to draw on the cultural capital encoded in the market-tested Hokusai "brand" and in so doing opened the waves to interpretations that kept them fresh. This practice, made possible by the print medium, enabled artists and audience alike to take part in an evolving
dialogue about how the lived space of Japan was to be con- structed. Instantiating both the island nation's vulnerability to foreign invasion and its power to resist it, waves encoded a perspective at once defensive and outward oriented. Even as they constituted a fluid boundary whose breaching opened up opportunities for foreign encounters, by their relentless- ness and magnitude, they also gave intimations of Japan's own expansionist potential. Socially and culturally con- structed boundaries play a crucial role in the preservation or transformation of a given worldview, one that often goes unexamined as long as the environment remains stable and ordered. When circumstances change, however, new, more meaningful codes are required. Hokusai's great waves arose ni just such a context, offering the promise of a global flow of people and goods, even as their circulation helped to fashion an imagined community that solidified the symbolic bound- aries of the nation.
