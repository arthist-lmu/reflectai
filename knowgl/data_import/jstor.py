Messrs. Auffermann &r Ob.:,proprietors of\"The American Wood Staining Works,\" located at .158 West 27th Street, New York, stain their woodsby a-process known as the 'VSystfeme Auffermann,\" which is in high lavor in Europe: By this method of staining veneers, the boards are colored not merely to a shal low depth, but are stained through their entire body. The dye penetrates the pores of the wood, which retains all its specific, markmgs, togetber, with the brillialhcy of color wbich has been imparted to it. . , * Fancy woods and veneers are in great demand in modern cabinet making, and anything that will not only render the work done more beautiful, but will also lessen the time necessary to finish it, must recommend itself to the manufacturers of fine furniture. The piano manufacturers in particular will be greatly interested in such an enterprise, because of the facility with . which veneer stained a deep jet black, or other color can be procured, The Aufferman ebony stain produces a rich jet black color without spots, or streaks of false glimmer, which hot only improves the appearance of the piano, but reduces the cost by reason of the time and labor saved. In their, veneers another advantage consists in the fact that the mouldings, consoles, ornaments, etc., are all identical in appearance and effect, with the case proper. In the case of colored and figured woods, beautiful imita tions of oak, cherry, mahogany, cedar and other fancy woods are produced at a very low price and are surprisingly true to nature. Very beautiful mosiac patterns are wrought in stained woods for the tops of occasional tables and for chess boards, in which extremely beautiful patterns are produced. Different strips of variously colored woods when glued together, side by side, are afterwards cut according to the exigencies of various patterns for marquetry inlays and borders for jewelery boxes, music boxes, writing cases, toilet cases, decorative panels, etc. The manufacturers of wood carpets have been endeavoring for some time past to produce parquetry floors that would rival the beauty of design and color which Is loudly praised in Orien tal carpets, but the difficulty that has hitherty prevented them from consummating the idea, is the fact that natural woods are extremely limited in their variety of color tints, and that it would be impossible to produce designs with all the Wealth of dull reds, greens, browns, blues and yellows that form > the at traction in wool fabrics. Now, however, this difficulty is: removed at a single stroke. Wood vineers f or :parquetry pnrpo^svare produced in every known shade of color, sotherma^'u^agtpfer v has only to go to work; and~produce his Oriental designf* being sure that he can execute them in every possible jtoh^ypf-rppior known to Oriental rugs.\" This is a great step in the developement of wood carpets, and one that isr sure to be jhade. tLBe^ofl^lSy-in terior remodelers, who include wood ^carpeting ais ay^qikc&a of ; their business: .

' We have all of us seen parquetry floors in cherry ,redS, ioak browns, mahogany reds and maple yellows;--itis now p^sible for us to see the maple, oak, cherry^ or mahogany>flodr^i^ahy tone of color, as well as in the natural tint, ail idea made pos sible by the Auffermarin system of staining woods. :v ; In the sample card before usj. strips of white Wood )$qpl& }'' ''' ;;.) bird's-eye maple are stained French gray, Scpbeloff green, purple, yy\"r<* pink, camellia red, blondine, tobacco brown, old rose, coquelicot, ..-.-:y Bresil red, ble-cPor, toreador, Australian gold, .\" iej^^-'V^aQl'e^. ;i_._:' /-^ autumn brown, magnolia green, marine blue, and Persian helio-' \\- iyy trope.

' \":\" ..\"\"':: -:*| PURCHASING wali-paiper at one establishment, carpets at y/i another, curtains somewhere else and furniture upholstery in another place, each article being purchased as it strikes ^ ^5i the fancy of the buyer, frequently produces a perfectly meaning- /y ? less result when, the Work of furnishing is done. A decorator informs us that he uees a size for gold leaf ^jiidii;;/:/:fe: if properly made has no equal whether the gilding be o^pe >r :ry on wood, glass or metal. Be claims it to be the \"sexsiet'': * y % size\" used by the best artists of London and;Paris, ahoV \"by.tlie :'? ->;* ' justly celebrated Japanese of London, who produce the finest -y.'}$? work in gold decoration in their line to -be found in the wprid?s : y\\-y: market. The formula is as follows : Take one pound Of good.; ' '^ pure drying oil; \"put it in a metal pot with a cover ; slowly add r :\"y>< to this] after it has come almost to a boiling jioint, four ounces / ' / v ^ of pure powdered gum animi, (not copal which is sometimes Y? confounded with it.) Take the animi on the point of a 0$&tiJ knife and put it in cautiously little by little, allowing ea^ s^^J^ ^> ply time to. dissolve, all the white stirring the mixture. &ol| '^^i'^'i the consistency of tar, and while warm, strain through a pieced-^^ silk into a heated wide-mouthed bottle, keep well corked, a^ y*J when required, thin with turpentine and mix thoroughly. If ]a '' <\"; ;} little vermilion is ground with the size it will show better what i is being done in using it. THERE are lost art secrets many of Which would prove.valu able if recovered and some of which are the constant sub-. V ject of research in this and other countries. Amoiig indi viduals thus engaged are the Japanese potters who are still in ; search of the means of compounding the sang de b'ceufy the dragons heart, and that ancient and wonderful Chinese black which has green and gold in its gloom. Their labors.in this direction have not been without reward^ for they have brought to light the means of producing the beautiful blue under the glaze of the celebrated Satsuma. ware. The Chinese halve; lost the secret of the superb blue that once decorated their table ware and vases; and so with other tones of color. England, France and Germany discoverers of decorative materials and new processes, environed these with so much secrecy in their life time that the art of which they were the exclusive possessors died with them. Within the past ten years not a few of the arts\" of the secrets of the old Venetian glass makers have been brought to light, but the method by which these gave unrivalled light ness to their crystal wares so far defies discovery. All that our table glass requires is greater lightness, but the quantity of lead necessary to secure its present luster and brilliancy defeats this purpose. While some re-discoveries have been arrived at by per sistent experiments, others have been made by accident. It is not, however, every lost art that would commercially pay, or if brought to light would prove of present value. 44"
