# WP3: Multimodal analysis of artworks using a hybrid AI approach

In WP 3, hybrid multimodal deep learning methods for the analysis of artworks based on domain-specific expert knowledge are researched. 
Due to the black box property of deep learning architectures, explainable AI methods and visualizations are developed to better understand and evaluate the obtained results with respect to the biases described (WP 4).
